This article aimed to determine the PSB, psilocin (PS), baeocystin (BA), norbaeocystin (NB), and aeruginascin (AE) concentrations in a large sample set of mushrooms belonging to genera previously reported to contain psychotropic tryptamines. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify tryptamine alkaloids in the mushroom samples. Most mushroom collections were documented by fungarium specimens and/or ITS rDNA/LSU/EF1-α sequencing. Concentrations of five tryptamine alkaloids were determined in a large sample set of 226 fruiting bodies of 82 individual collections from seven mushroom genera. For many mushroom species, concentrations of BA, NB, and AE are reported for the first time. The highest PSB/PS concentrations were found in Psilocybe species, but no tryptamines were detected in the P. fuscofulva and P. fimetaria collections. The tryptamine concentrations in mushrooms are extremely variable, representing a problem for mushroom consumers due to the apparent risk of overdose. The varied cocktail of tryptamines in wild mushrooms could influence the medicinal effect compared to therapy with chemically pure PSB, posing a serious problem for data interpretation.","We thank all people who willingly donated their mushroom collections for analysis—without their assistance, this study would not be possible.

8163,pub.1150727369,10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2297,,PMC9568164,,A Review of Aeruginascin and Potential Entourage Effect in Hallucinogenic Mushrooms,"Introduction
          The 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelic, psilocybin (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is a tryptophan, indole-based alkaloid present in up to 2% of certain hallucinogenic “magic” mushroom species; typically Psilocybe azurescens, semilanceata, and cyanescens,. In addition, mushrooms may contain psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine). Both are indolylalkylamines (tryptamines); other naturally occurring tryptamine compounds include norbaeocystin, baeocystin, norpsilocin, and aeruginascin. A putative synergistic contribution of these compounds has been referred to as the “entourage” effect. Aeruginascin (N,N,N-trimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine) is found naturally in Inocybe aeruginascens and Pholiotina cyanopus mushroom species and ingestion reportedly invokes elevation in mood without accompanying hallucinogenic effects:


          Objectives
          To review the pharmacology of aeruginascin and putative entourage effect.


          Methods
          The extant literature on aeruginascin was reviewed and discussed.


          Results
          Methylation of aeruginascin results in an active metabolite, 4-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethyltryptamine (4-HO-TMT) which has been shown to bind at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptors with Inhibition Constants (Ki) of 4400, 670, and 120 nM respectively; compared with psilocybin’s binding of 567.4, 107.2 and 4.6 nM respectively. Further, 4-HO-TMT does not bind at the 5-HT3 receptor, and as a quaternary trimethylammonium compound it is less likely to be able to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB).


          Conclusions
          There are very limited data with respect to the pharmacology of aeruginascin. Its activity at serotonin receptors is less by several orders of magnitude than psilocybin and it has potentially less brain penetrance. Given that it is found in different mushrooms species the data would suggest that its direct contribution to any entourage effect is limited. Further research in needed into other naturally occurring tryptamine compounds.

Owing to their structural similarity and zwitterionic nature, the compounds were difficult to resolve based on different interactions with cationic or anionic micelles. However, while the attempts with micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) were unsuccessful, rapid derivatization with propyl chloroformate and reanalysis by CZE at pH 11.5 was effective to support identification of the two indole alkaloids.

Psilocybin and its pharmacologically active metabolite psilocin in particular are known for their psychoactive effects. These substances typically occur in most species of the genus Psilocybe (Fungi, Strophariaceae). Even the sclerotia of some of these fungi known as ""magic truffles"" are of growing interest in microdosing due to them improving cognitive function studies. In addition to microdosing studies, psilocybin has also been applied in clinical studies, but only its pure form has been administrated so far. Moreover, the determination of tryptamine alkaloids is used in forensic analysis. In this study, freshly cultivated fruit bodies of Psilocybe cubensis were used for monitoring stability (including storage and processing conditions of fruiting bodies). Furthermore, mycelium and the individual parts of the fruiting bodies (caps, stipes, and basidiospores) were also examined. The concentration of tryptamines in final extracts was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. No tryptamines were detected in the basidiospores, and only psilocin was present at 0.47 wt.% in the mycelium. The stipes contained approximately half the amount of tryptamine alkaloids (0.52 wt.%) than the caps (1.03 wt.%); however, these results were not statistically significant, as the concentration of tryptamines in individual fruiting bodies is highly variable. The storage conditions showed that the highest degradation of tryptamines was seen in fresh mushrooms stored at -80°C, and the lowest decay was seen in dried biomass stored in the dark at room temperature.",This work was supported by the long‐term development projects RVO67985831 (Institute of Geology of the Czech Academy of Sciences) and RVO61389005 (Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences) and the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic (MV0/VI20172020056).,,Drug Testing and Analysis,,Wiley,"1942-7603, 1942-7611","Biomass; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Psilocybe; Psilocybin; Psychotropic Drugs; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",04/11/2020,2020,04/11/2020,2021-02,13,2,439-446,Closed,Article,"Gotvaldová, Klára; Hájková, Kateřina; Borovička, Jan; Jurok, Radek; Cihlářová, Petra; Kuchař, Martin","Gotvaldová, Klára (Forensic Laboratory of Biologically Active Substances, Department of Chemistry of Natural Compounds, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Prague 6–Dejvice, Czech Republic); Hájková, Kateřina (Forensic Laboratory of Biologically Active Substances, Department of Chemistry of Natural Compounds, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Prague 6–Dejvice, Czech Republic; Department of Brain Electrophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health, Klecany, Czech Republic); Borovička, Jan (Institute of Geology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague 6, Czech Republic; Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Husinec, Czech Republic); Jurok, Radek (Forensic Laboratory of Biologically Active Substances, Department of Chemistry of Natural Compounds, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Prague 6–Dejvice, Czech Republic; Department of Brain Electrophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health, Klecany, Czech Republic; Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Prague 6–Dejvice, Czech Republic); Cihlářová, Petra (Forensic Laboratory of Biologically Active Substances, Department of Chemistry of Natural Compounds, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Prague 6–Dejvice, Czech Republic; Department of Brain Electrophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health, Klecany, Czech Republic); Kuchař, Martin (Forensic Laboratory of Biologically Active Substances, Department of Chemistry of Natural Compounds, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Prague 6–Dejvice, Czech Republic; Department of Experimental Neurobiology, National Institute of Mental Health, Klecany, Czech Republic)","Kuchař, Martin (University of Chemistry and Technology; National Institute of Mental Health)","Gotvaldová, Klára (University of Chemistry and Technology); Hájková, Kateřina (University of Chemistry and Technology; National Institute of Mental Health); Borovička, Jan (Czech Academy of Sciences; Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences); Jurok, Radek (University of Chemistry and Technology; National Institute of Mental Health; University of Chemistry and Technology); Cihlářová, Petra (University of Chemistry and Technology; National Institute of Mental Health); Kuchař, Martin (University of Chemistry and Technology; National Institute of Mental Health)",Czech Academy of Sciences; Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Chemistry and Technology; National Institute of Mental Health,grid.418095.1; grid.425110.3; grid.448072.d; grid.447902.c,Prague; Řež; Prague; Klecany,; ; ; ,Czechia; Czechia; Czechia; Czechia,Czech Academy of Sciences; Ministry of the Interior,,Czechia; Czechia,grant.6882447,VI20172020056,22,22,6.07,6.42,10,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132137311,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that with the exception of P. laetissima, which is now rightfully classified in the genus Leratiomyces, all investigated species belong to Psilocybe sect. Psilocybe. For the first time, psychotropic compounds psilocin and psilocybin were detected in P. medullosa using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. On the contrary, neither psilocin, nor psilocybin was detected in P. atrobrunnea and negative results were also obtained from mycelia grown in vitro on tryptamine/tryptophan-amended media. These results strongly suggest that biosynthesis of these alkaloids was lost in P. atrobrunnea. With the exception of minor differences detected in EF1-α marker, all sequences of American and European collections of P. atrobrunnea were identical. On the other hand, a thorough nomenclatural study revealed that the name P. atrobrunnea must be considered dubious; the oldest available candidate name, P. fuscofulva, was therefore adopted. The molecular data suggests that morphologically identical American P. silvatica and European P. medullosa likely represent distinct species; epitypes of both taxa were therefore designated.","We are very grateful to colleagues and curators who kindly provided information or collections from their herbaria for microscopic study and/or molecular analysis: Vladimír Antonín (BRNM), Joseph F.

The approved existing studies constitute a piece of strong evidence whereby psychiatric drugs have shown to have unpleasant side effects and reduction of sustained tolerability, impacting patients' quality of life. Thus, the implementation of innovative strategies and alternative sources of bioactive molecules for the search for neuropsychiatric agents are required to guarantee the success of more effective drug candidates. Psychotherapeutic use of indole alkaloids derived from magic mushrooms has shown great interest and potential as an alternative to the synthetic drugs currently used on the market. The focus on indole alkaloids is linked to their rich history, their use as pharmaceuticals, and their broad range of biological properties, collectively underscoring the indole heterocycle as significant in drug discovery. In this review, we aim to report the physicochemical and pharmacological characteristics of indole alkaloids, particularly those derived from magic mushrooms, highlighting the promising application of such active ingredients as safe and effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",,"This research was funded by MITACS, grant number FR69791.",Biomedicines,,MDPI,2227-9059,,05/02/2023,2023,05/02/2023,,11,2,461,All OA; Gold,Article,"Plazas, Erika; Faraone, Nicoletta","Plazas, Erika (Department of Chemistry, Acadia University, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada.); Faraone, Nicoletta (Department of Chemistry, Acadia University, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada.)","Faraone, Nicoletta (Acadia University)","Plazas, Erika (Acadia University); Faraone, Nicoletta (Acadia University)",Acadia University,grid.411959.1,Wolfville,Nova Scotia,Canada,Mitacs,,Canada,,,0,0,,,7,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/2/461/pdf?version=1676617468,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155171020,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,Mental Health; Neurosciences,Mental health,5.1 Pharmaceuticals,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being

This is demonstrated here in a case in which a 'shaman' was accused of causing the death of a young man. The deceased had participated in a ceremony which involved the drinking of ayahuasca in order to induce a psychotropic experience. Ayahuasca is an infusion of Banisteriopsis caapi (ayahuasca vine), which produces a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and one or more additional tropical plants, generally Psychotria viridis (chacruna) which produces dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents DMT from being broken down in the gut, so enabling its passage into the bloodstream and across the blood/brain barrier. Toxicological tests for DMT demonstrated the presence of this compound in the body. The deceased was reported to be in the habit of using Psilocybe semilanceata (liberty cap). This fungus (popularly called magic mushroom) contains psilocybin which is hydrolysed in the gut to psilocin; this compound mimics a serotonin uptake inhibitor, and also invokes psychotropic experiences. Microscopical examination established that the ileum and colon contained spores of Psilocybe and, in addition, pollen of Cannabis sativa and seeds of Papaver cf. somniferum (opium poppy). Both the plant species yield psychotropic substances. Palynological and mycological analysis of containers from the deceased person's dwelling also yielded abundant trace evidence of pertinent pollen and spores. The police had requested analysis for DMT but there was no screening for other psychotropic substances. Investigators were surprised that a mixture of hallucinogenic materials had been consumed by the deceased. The charge was modified from manslaughter to possession of a 'Class A' drug as the deceased had been consuming psychotropic substances not administered by the 'shaman'. Where death involving drugs from plants or fungi is suspected, microscopical examination of samples from the gut can provide a rapid and effective method for assessing, in a temporal context, the presence of ingested materials that may not have been previously suspected. The example presented here also demonstrates the need for caution in interpreting toxicological results where screening for unusual compounds has been limited.","We are indebted to the Coroner for granting permission to publish the results of this investigation, and to Dr Begoña Aguirre-Hudson for enabling the examination and photography of material in the neurotropic Psilocybe reference collections held at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, under conditions permitted by the Home Office regulations in force.

However, there is uncertainty about how much harm they can cause at what doses. This review aimed to collect information on the health-hazardous doses of psychedelic substances, to be aware of the risks to which patients may be subjected. We focused on ergolamines, simple tryptamines, and phenylethylamines. We reviewed articles published in major medical and scientific databases. Studies reporting toxic or lethal doses in humans and animals were included. We followed PRISMA criteria for revisions. We identified 3032 manuscripts for inclusion. Of these, 33 were ultimately useful and gave relevant information about effects associated with high psychedelics doses. Despite having different molecular structures and different mechanisms of action, psychedelics are effective at very low doses, are not addictive, and are harmful at extremely high doses. For LSD and psilocybin, no dose has been established above which the lives of users are endangered. In contrast, MDMA appears to be the most dangerous substance, although reports are biased by recreational missuses. It seems that it is not only the dose that makes the poison.

The hallucinogenic substances were effectively isolated, by using methanol, from the species of Psilocybe semilanceata and Pholiotina cyanopus, that were collected in the north-east region of Poland. The chemical analysis of these extracts, which was performed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS), indicated the presence of psilocin and other hallucinogenic substances, including indolealkylamines and their phosphorylated analogues. When the pure psilocin or fungal extracts were used, slight differences in determined LD50 values were observed. However, the application of PC evoked the highest level of toxicity (293.07 mg/kg) compared to the activity of extracts from Ph. cyanopus and P. semilanceata, where the level of LD50 was 316.87 mg/kg and 324.37 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the behavioral test, which considered the head-twitching response (HTR), was used to assess the effects of the studied psychotropic factors on the serotonergic system. Both, the fungal extracts and psilocin evoked characteristic serotoninergic effects depending on the dose administered to mice, acting as an agonist/partial agonist on the serotonergic system. A dose of 200 mg/kg 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced spontaneous head-twitching in mice (100% effect), as a result of the formation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain. Compared to the activity of 5-HTP, the intraperitoneal administration of 1mg/kg of psilocin or hallucinogenic extracts of studied mushrooms (Ph. cyanopus and P. semilanceata) reduced the number of head-twitch responses of about 46% and 30%, respectively. In contrast, the administration of PC exhibited a reduction of about 60% in HTR numbers.","The research was supported by Wrocław Research Centre EIT+ under the project “Biotechnologies and advanced medical technologies”—BioMed (POIG.01.01.02-02-003/08) financed by the European Regional Development Fund (Operational Programme Innovative Economy, 1.1.2).",,Toxins,,MDPI,2072-6651,"Agaricales; Animals; Animals, Outbred Strains; Behavior, Animal; Complex Mixtures; Female; Hallucinogens; Lethal Dose 50; Methanol; Mice; Psilocybin; Solvents",27/03/2015,2015,27/03/2015,,7,4,1018-1029,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhuk, Olga; Jasicka-Misiak, Izabela; Poliwoda, Anna; Kazakova, Anastasia; Godovan, Vladlena V.; Halama, Marek; Wieczorek, Piotr P.","Zhuk, Olga (Department of Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, Opole University, 45-040 Opole, Poland; E-Mail:, olga_zhuk@uni.opole.pl); Jasicka-Misiak, Izabela (Faculty of Chemistry, Opole University, 45-040 Opole, Poland; E-Mails:, anna.poliwoda@uni.opole.pl, (A.P.);, piotr.wieczorek@uni.opole.pl, (P.P.W.)); Poliwoda, Anna (Faculty of Chemistry, Opole University, 45-040 Opole, Poland; E-Mails:, anna.poliwoda@uni.opole.pl, (A.P.);, piotr.wieczorek@uni.opole.pl, (P.P.W.)); Kazakova, Anastasia (Department of General and Clinical Pharmacology, Odessa National Medical University, 65000 Odessa, Ukraine; E-Mails:, ignozy@gmail.com, (A.K.);, godovan@mail.ru, (V.V.G.)); Godovan, Vladlena V.

Occasionally, this results in adverse reactions with typical tachycardia that is not evidently caused by psilocybin. This study demonstrates the presence of phenylethylamine in the species Psilocybe semilanceata using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and shows that the amount of this substance may vary much more than that of psilocybin. The highest amount of phenylethylamine (146 microg/g wet weight) was observed in mushrooms from a case of three young men hospitalized because of adverse reactions.

However, use of psilocybin as a healing entheogen has a long history through traditional consumption of mushrooms from the genus Psilocybe. The forthcoming adoption of new psilocybin-assisted therapeutic practices necessitates identification of preferred sources of psilocybin; consequently, comprehensive understanding of psilocybin-containing fungi is fundamental to consumer safety. Here we examine psilocybin producing fungi, discuss their biology, diversity, and ethnomycological uses.

There are a large number of reports about ingestion of poisonous mushrooms every year around the world. It attracts the attention of researchers, especially in the aspects of toxin composition, toxic mechanism and toxin application in poisonous mushroom. Inocybe is a large genus of mushrooms and contains toxic substances including muscarine, psilocybin, psilocin, aeruginascin, lectins and baeocystin. In order to prevent and remedy mushroom poisoning, it is significant to clarify the toxic effects and mechanisms of these bioactive substances. In this review article, we summarize the chemistry, most known toxic effects and mechanisms of major toxic substances in Inocybe mushrooms, especially muscarine, psilocybin and psilocin. Their available toxicity data (different species, different administration routes) published formerly are also summarized. In addition, the treatment and medical application of these toxic substances in Inocybe mushrooms are also discussed. We hope that this review will help understanding of the chemistry and toxicology of Inocybe mushrooms as well as the potential clinical application of its bioactive substances to benefit human beings.",,"This work was supported by the long-term organization development plan (University Hospital, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic), National Key R & D Program (2016YFD0501207, 2016YFD0501009), NSFC (31972741, 31572576), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2016T90477), PAPD.

Currently, the use of these mushrooms is illegal in most countries, but where their use is legal they are applied as self medication. Psilocybin and psilocin, two psychoactive alkaloids, are naturally synthesized by hallucinogenic mushrooms. The chemical structure of these compounds are similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Activation of this system by psilocybin and psilocin may produce temporary changes in the brain that induce hallucinations and feelings of euphoria. Adjustment of the serotonin system in this way can moderate symptoms of related mental disorders.

Recently, we observed that P. eryngii produces molecules that have antidepressant functions. An ethanol extract of the fruiting body of P. eryngii was obtained, and the extract was purified by XAD-16 resin using an open column system. The ethanol eluate was separated by HPLC, and the fraction with an antidepressant function was identified. Using LC-MS, the molecular structure of the HPLC fraction with antidepressant function was identified as that of tryptamine, a functional molecule that is a tryptophan derivative. The antidepressant effect was identified from the ethanol extract, XAD-16 column eluate, and HPLC fraction by a serotonin receptor binding assay and a cell-based binding assay. Furthermore, a forced swimming test (FST) showed that the mice treated with purified fractions of P. eryngii exhibited decreased immobility time compared with nontreated mice. From these results, we suggest that the extract of P. eryngii has an antidepressant function and that it may be employed as an antidepressant health supplement.","This work was carried out with the support of the Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development (Project No: PJ01368101), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.",This research received no external funding.,Journal of Fungi,,MDPI,2309-608X,,08/03/2021,2021,08/03/2021,,7,3,190,All OA; Gold,Article,"Park, Yong-Sung; Jang, Subin; Lee, Hyunkoo; Kang, Suzie; Seo, Hyewon; Yeon, Seoyeong; Lee, Dongho; Yun, Cheol-Won","Park, Yong-Sung (School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea;, dcomtrue@korea.ac.kr, (Y.-S.P.);, scvxx@hanmail.net, (S.J.);, dlgusrn0524@naver.com, (H.L.);, sthe327@korea.ac.kr, (S.K.);, hyewon330@korea.ac.kr, (H.S.)); Jang, Subin (School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea;, dcomtrue@korea.ac.kr, (Y.-S.P.);, scvxx@hanmail.net, (S.J.);, dlgusrn0524@naver.com, (H.L.);, sthe327@korea.ac.kr, (S.K.);, hyewon330@korea.ac.kr, (H.S.)); Lee, Hyunkoo (School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea;, dcomtrue@korea.ac.kr, (Y.-S.P.);, scvxx@hanmail.net, (S.J.);, dlgusrn0524@naver.com, (H.L.);, sthe327@korea.ac.kr, (S.K.);, hyewon330@korea.ac.kr, (H.S.)); Kang, Suzie (School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea;, dcomtrue@korea.ac.kr, (Y.-S.P.);, scvxx@hanmail.net, (S.J.);, dlgusrn0524@naver.com, (H.L.);, sthe327@korea.ac.kr, (S.K.);, hyewon330@korea.ac.kr, (H.S.)); Seo, Hyewon (School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea;, dcomtrue@korea.ac.kr, (Y.-S.P.);, scvxx@hanmail.net, (S.J.);, dlgusrn0524@naver.com, (H.L.);, sthe327@korea.ac.kr, (S.K.);, hyewon330@korea.ac.kr, (H.S.)); Yeon, Seoyeong (Department of Plant Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea;, stopyear322@naver.com, (S.Y.);, dongholee@korea.ac.kr, (D.L.)); Lee, Dongho (Department of Plant Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea;, stopyear322@naver.com, (S.Y.);, dongholee@korea.ac.kr, (D.L.)); Yun, Cheol-Won (School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea;, dcomtrue@korea.ac.kr, (Y.-S.P.);, scvxx@hanmail.net, (S.J.);, dlgusrn0524@naver.com, (H.L.);, sthe327@korea.ac.kr, (S.K.);, hyewon330@korea.ac.kr, (H.S.); NeuroEsgel Co., Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea)","Yun, Cheol-Won (Korea University; ; )","Park, Yong-Sung (Korea University); Jang, Subin (Korea University); Lee, Hyunkoo (Korea University); Kang, Suzie (Korea University); Seo, Hyewon (Korea University); Yeon, Seoyeong (Korea University); Lee, Dongho (Korea University); Yun, Cheol-Won (Korea University)",Korea University,grid.222754.4,Seoul,,South Korea,Rural Development Administration,,South Korea,,,8,8,1.3,2.95,1,https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/7/3/190/pdf?version=1623134686,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136246655,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

Despite their significance, the secondary metabolome of these fungi is poorly understood in general. Our analysis of four Psilocybe species identified harmane, harmine, and a range of other l-tryptophan-derived β-carbolines as their natural products, which was confirmed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Stable-isotope labeling with 13 C11 -l-tryptophan verified the β-carbolines as biosynthetic products of these fungi. In addition, MALDI-MS imaging showed that β-carbolines accumulate toward the hyphal apices. As potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidases, β-carbolines are neuroactive compounds and interfere with psilocybin degradation. Therefore, our findings represent an unprecedented scenario of natural product pathways that diverge from the same building block and produce dissimilar compounds, yet contribute directly or indirectly to the same pharmacological effects.","Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge A.

Although some products containing cadmium can be recycled, much of the pollution with this metal is the result of inadequate disposal and uncontrolled incineration of cadmium-containing waste (Jarup, 2003). Copper particles are released into the atmosphere from copper smelters and ore processing facilities, as well as from anthropogenic sources (use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides). Oxidative stress occurs due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease) or reduced ability of cells to neutralize it through their internal antioxidants (eg mutation of the superoxide dismutase gene in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).


          Objectives
          The aim of this research was to examine the protective role of supplement, GSH, S-donor ligand, and in conditions of acute and chronic intoxication with sublethal doses of cadmium-II-chloride and copper II sulfate.


          Methods
          After medial laparotomy albino rates Wistar soy, a 10% homogenate of brain tissue was made in an appropriate medium and an analysis of acid and alkaline DNase activity was performed (Kocić i sar., 2004; Kocić i sar., 1998).


          Results
          This experiment demonstrated the beneficial role of GSH supplement that exhibit antioxidant character in preventing and reducing the adverse effects of acute and chronic cadmium and copper intoxication.


          Conclusions
          Antioxidants prevent the formation of oxidative stress in the cell by reducing and stopping DNA damage and degradation, and thus represent potential scavengers of free radicals.

Possession of the fungal species that contain these compounds is a criminal offence in North America. Some related species that are morphologically similar, do not contain the controlled substances. Therefore, unambiguous identification of fungi to the species level is critical in determining if a mushroom is illegal. We investigate a phylogenetic approach for the identification of species that contain the psychoactive compounds. We analyzed 35 North American specimens representing seven different genera of hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic mushrooms. We amplified and sequenced the internal transcribed spacer region of the rDNA (ITS-1) and a 5' portion of the nuclear large ribosomal subunit of rRNA (nLSU rRNA or 28S). ITS-1 locus sequence data was highly variable and produced a phylogenetic resolution that was not consistent with morphological identifications. In contrast, the nLSU rRNA data clustered isolates from the same species and separated hallucinogen containing and non-hallucinogen containing isolates into distinct clades. With this information, we propose an approach that combines the specificity of PCR detection and the resolving power of phylogenetic analysis to efficiently and unambiguously identify hallucinogenic fungal specimens for legal purposes.","We would like to thank Dr. Scott Redhead, Curator of the National Mycological Herbarium (DAOM), for his aid in selecting fungal isolates and Carolyn Babcock, Curator of the Canadian Collection of Fungal Cultures (ECORC), for providing us with the cultures on behalf of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

A five year population study (1977-81) was undertaken in urban children from Brisbane (population 1 000 000). A total of 2098 children were poisoned during this period with only one fatality, which represents a dramatic reduction in mortality. Over the past 15 years (1968-82) 13 children have died from accidental poisoning from this population, and two were murdered with drugs. A study of secular trends has indicated that peak incidence occurred in 1979, and the rate has been falling progressively since. The current age corrected rate of poisoning is 393 per 100 000 children per year (0-5 year olds). The rank order of poisons, drugs, and chemicals causing hospital admission and death is: petroleum distillates 13%; antihistamines 9%; benzodiazepines 9%; bleach and detergents 7%; and aspirin 6%. The ratio of fatalities to ingestions requiring hospital admission was calculated to give an index of a practical danger of noxious agents to which children are currently exposed and the rank order is: cardiotoxic drugs, one fatality to 25 ingestions; tricyclic antidepressants, one to 44; sympathomimetic drugs, one to 54; caustic soda, one to 68; aspirin, one fatality to 350 ingestions.

A number of extraction methods for psilocin and psilocybin in hallucinogenic mushrooms were investigated, with a simple methanolic extraction being found to be most effective. Psilocin and psilocybin were extracted from a variety of hallucinogenic mushrooms using methanol. The analytes were separated on a C12 column using a (95:5% v/v) methanol:10 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.5 mobile phase with a run time of 5 min. Detection was realized through a dual reagent chemiluminescence detection system of acidic potassium permanganate and tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II). The chemiluminescence detection system gave improved detectability when compared with UV absorption at 269 nm, with detection limits of 1.2 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-9) mol/L being obtained for psilocin and psilocybin, respectively. The procedure was applied to the determination of psilocin and psilocybin in three Australian species of hallucinogenic mushroom.","Acknowledgments Funding for this project was provided via a Linkage Grant from the Australian Research Council in collaboration with the Victoria Police Forensic Services Center and Forensic Science South Australia.

METHODS: Two hundred twenty-one samples of clinical forensic material (dried mushrooms, food remains, stomach contents, feces, etc) were analyzed. ITS2 region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) was sequenced and the sequen-ces were compared with reference sequences collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene bank (GenBank). Sporological identification of mushrooms was also performed for 57 samples of clinical material.
RESULTS: Of 221 samples, positive sequencing results were obtained for 152 (69%). The highest percentage of positive results was obtained for samples of dried mushrooms (96%) and food remains (91%). Comparison with GenBank sequences enabled identification of all samples at least at the genus level. Most samples (90%) were identified at the level of species or a group of closely related species. Sporological and molecular identification were consistent at the level of species or genus for 30% of analyzed samples.
CONCLUSION: Molecular analysis identified a larger number of species than sporological method. It proved to be suitable for analysis of evidential material (dried hallucinogenic mushrooms) in forensic genetic laboratories as well as to complement classical methods in the analysis of clinical material.","Funding The research was funded by the Polish National Science Centre, project N N404 202439 “Application of sequence analysis of regions ITS1 and ITS2 of nrDNA to species identification of poisonous and hallucinogenic mushrooms for forensic purposes.” Ethical approval Not required.

This study involved bioanalytical and clinical examinations of intoxication cases suspected to be linked to such plant materials.
METHODS: Urine samples were collected at emergency wards in Sweden from patients who either admitted or were suspected of ingestion of psychoactive plant materials. The bioanalytical investigation employed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry multicomponent method covering 10 plant-derived substances (atropine, dimethyltryptamine, ephedrine, harmaline, harmine, ibogaine, lysergic acid amide, psilocin, scopolamine, and yohimbine) and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for asarone. Routine testing for illicit drugs was also performed.
RESULTS: Over a 4-year period, 103 urine samples collected from mainly young people (age range 13-52 years, median 19) were studied. Among 53 cases where ingestion of any of the 11 plant-derived substances covered in this study was admitted or suspected, 41 (77%) could be confirmed bioanalytically. Nine of the 11 substances tested for were detected, the exceptions being ibogaine and yohimbine. Psilocin, originating from ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms, was the most frequent drug accounting for 54% of the cases. The most common means of drug acquisition (56%) was purchase over the Internet.
CONCLUSION: The patients using psychoactive plant materials were mainly young and commonly used the Internet for drug acquisition. Having access to bioanalytical methods for detection of plant-derived psychoactives is therefore considered important, when providing clinical toxicology service.",This study was supported by grants from the Swedish National Institute of Public Health and the Swedish National Drug Policy Coordinator.,,Clinical Toxicology,,Taylor & Francis,"1556-3650, 1556-9519","Adolescent; Adult; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hallucinogens; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Plant Extracts; Plants, Toxic; Poisoning; Psychotropic Drugs; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Young Adult",08/07/2009,2009,08/07/2009,2009-07,47,6,566-572,Closed,Article,"Björnstad, Kristian; Hultén, Peter; Beck, Olof; Helander, Anders","Björnstad, Kristian (Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Alcohol laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden); Hultén, Peter (Swedish Poisons Information Centre, Stockholm, Sweden); Beck, Olof (Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden); Helander, Anders (Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Alcohol laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden)","Björnstad, Kristian (Karolinska Institute)","Björnstad, Kristian (Karolinska Institute); Hultén, Peter (Karolinska University Hospital); Beck, Olof (Karolinska Institute); Helander, Anders (Karolinska Institute)",Karolinska Institute; Karolinska University Hospital,grid.4714.6; grid.24381.3c,Stockholm; Stockholm,; ,Sweden; Sweden,,,,,,33,4,1.16,3.95,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009025516,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,Substance Misuse,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being

Despite their well-documented neurotoxicity, they reached reputation of being safe and nonaddictive. Scientific efforts to find any medical application for these hallucinogens in psychiatry, psychotherapy, and even for religious rituals support are highly controversial. Even if they show any healing potential, their usage in psychotherapy is in some cases inadequate and may additionally harm seriously suffering patients. Hallucinogens are thought to reduce cognitive functions. However, in case of indolealkylamines, such as psilocin, some recent findings suggest their ability to improve perception and mental skills, what would motivate the consumption of ""magic mushrooms.""

Because no antibody was publicly available for this purpose, we generated two independent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Pyb or Psi, and then developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) by using them. To generate the specific antibodies, novel immunogenic conjugates were prepared by linking Pyb or Psi molecules to carrier proteins by modifying their 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl side chains. Spleen cells from mice immunized with these conjugates were fused with P3/NS1/1-Ag4-1 myeloma cells, and hybridoma clones secreting anti-Pyb and anti-Psi mAbs were established. These mAbs were characterized for their biochemical features and then applied to competitive ELISAs, which used microplates coated with Pyb or Psi linked with albumin. These ELISAs enabled the determination of Pyb or Psi with measurable ranges of ca. 0.20-20 or 0.040-2.0 μg/assay (limit of detection was 0.14 or 0.029 μg/assay), respectively. The related tryptamines were satisfactorily discriminated as exemplified by the cross-reactivity of the ELISA to determine Pyb (or Psi) with Psi (or Pyb) that were found to be 2.8 % (or <0.5 %), respectively. The Pyb and Psi contents in a dried powder of the hallucinogenic mushroom, Psilocybe cubensis, were determined to be 0.39 and 0.32 (w/w)%, respectively. The ELISAs developed using the current mAbs are promising tools for identifying illegal hallucinogenic mushrooms.",We thank Dr. Chisato Tode (Kobe Pharmaceutical University) for determining the NMR spectra.

Regrettably, they are among the most rigorously affected populations, along with several plants and animals, due to the destructive activities of mankind. Thus the authentication and conservation of mushroom species are constantly needed to exploit the remarkable potential in them. In this perspective, an attempt has been made to identify and assess the biological attributes of psychedelic mushrooms collected from Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India. The macromorphological features of the psychedelic mushroom DPT1 helped its presumptive identification and the molecular characters depicted by DNA marker revealed its close relationship with the genus Psilocybe. Accordingly, the psychedelic mushroom was identified as Psilocybe cubensis DPT1 and its crude ethyl acetate extract on analysis revealed the occurrence of phytoconstituents like alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and carbohydrates. Moreover, it exhibited 80% larvicidal activity against Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito at 800 ppm concentration and an array of antibacterial effects with utmost susceptibility of Proteus vulgaris, and the identification of bioactive compounds by different analytical techniques substantiate that the bioactivities might be due to the presence of phytochemicals.

It represents the prodrug to its dephosphorylated psychotropic analogue, psilocin. The colloquial term ""magic mushrooms"" for these fungi alludes to their hallucinogenic effects and to their use as recreational drugs. However, clinical trials have recognized psilocybin as a valuable candidate to be developed into a medication against depression and anxiety. We here highlight its recently elucidated biosynthesis, the concurrently developed concept of enzymatic in vitro and heterologous in vivo production, along with previous synthetic routes. The prospect of psilocybin as a promising therapeutic may entail an increased demand, which can be met by biotechnological production. Therefore, we also briefly touch on psilocybin's therapeutic relevance and pharmacology.","Acknowledgements We are grateful to Robert Kargbo (Usona Institute, Madison, WI) for valuable comments on the manuscript.

Although recognition can be facilitated by identification of a characteristic toxidrome, the presenting manifestations can be variable and have considerable overlap with more common and generally benign clinical syndromes. The goal of this two-part article is to review the knowledge base on this subject and provide information that will assist the clinician in the early consideration, diagnosis and treatment of mushroom poisoning.

As overdoses of traditional drugs of abuse decrease in light of legislative and de-prescribing initiatives, it stands to reason that alternative agents, including natural products, have increased. Toxicities associated with these agents have been contributing to emergency department visits across the globe.
AREAS COVERED: This evaluation covers salvia, kratom, and psilocybin mushrooms, and was accomplished through a comprehensive review of PubMed, SCOPUS, ProQuest Central, ProQuest Dissertations, and CINAHL. Thirty-one pieces of literature are included in this evaluation. The objective of this review is to provide clinicians with the information necessary to provide bedside care for overdoses of salvia, kratom, and psilocybin mushrooms.
EXPERT OPINION: Salvia, kratom, and psilocybin mushrooms may not be an initial consideration when healthcare practitioners are triaging an overdose scenario; however, data from around the world demonstrate an increased use of these agents. While not typically fatal, clinicians must be prepared to assess these as a potential etiology of overdoses and provide appropriate supportive care.",,This paper was not funded.,Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology,,Taylor & Francis,"1751-2433, 1751-2441",Animals; Drug Overdose; Hallucinogens; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Mitragyna; Mushroom Poisoning; Psilocybin; Salvia; Substance-Related Disorders,25/07/2020,2020,25/07/2020,02/08/2020,13,8,847-856,Closed,Article,"Reinert, Justin P.; Colunga, Kayla; Etuk, Alexandria; Richardson, Victoria; Dunn, Rebecca L.","Reinert, Justin P.

          Chronic hand eczema (CHE) , inflammatory dermatitis, can lead to physical and psychosocial disability altering the quality of life of these patients.


          Objectives
          The objective of this study was to examine the quality of life in patients with chronic hand eczema


          Methods
          Descriptive study collating patients who consulted for CHE, at the Dermatology Department of the CHU Hédi Chaker Sfax, during 3 years (2018-2020). A socio-demographic, clinic , and the Quality of life Questionnaire (DLQI) were administered in this study.


          Results
          Our study included 12 patients (8 men and 4 women). The mean age was 46.8±11.6 years. The patients were in professional activity in 86.8% of the cases. No patient was in early retirement or disability status. The average duration of the disease was 4.5 years (1- 9 years). All patients were in remission. The intensity of pruritus at the last attack was mild (25.77%), moderate (72.23%), and severe (2%). The impact of pruritus on sleep was noted in 100%. The mean total quality of life score (DLQI) was 6.8±5.5 which means a moderate impairment of quality of life


          Conclusions
          This work highlights the importance of the impact of this dermatitis on the quality of life of these patients. Therefore, multidisciplinary dermatological and psychiatric management is considered necessary

Often referred to as the ""Forgotten Kingdom"", fungi are key components of life on this planet. The phylum Basidiomycota, considered to contain the most complex and evolutionarily advanced members of this Kingdom, includes some of the most iconic fungal species such as the gilled mushrooms, puffballs and bracket fungi. Basidiomycetes inhabit a wide range of ecological niches, carrying out vital ecosystem roles, particularly in carbon cycling and as symbiotic partners with a range of other organisms. Specifically in the context of human use, the basidiomycetes are a highly valuable food source and are increasingly medicinally important. In this review, seven main categories, or 'roles', for basidiomycetes have been suggested by the authors: as model species, edible species, toxic species, medicinal basidiomycetes, symbionts, decomposers and pathogens, and two species have been chosen as representatives of each category.

In recent years, fungis' sclerotia, commonly called ""magic truffles"" have become a form of supply of psychoactive Psilocybe alkaloids since Psilocybe sclerotia are not specifically included in the laws banning the sale, the purchase and the use of such substances and mushrooms containing them. A liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the rapid determination of psilocybin and psilocin in Psilocybe sclerotia. Following a simple step extraction with methanol, the alkaloids were separated on a reversed-phase column using a gradient of 0.1% formic acid - acetonitrile s a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.. Separated analytes were detected by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. The developed method was linear over the calibration range for all two substances under investigation, with a r(2)  > 0.99. The detection and quantification limits were 0.3 µg and 1 µg per 100 mg truffles, for both psilocin and psilocybin and the intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were always better than 15%. Using this method, the presence of only psilocybin was demonstrated in examined Psilocybe sclerotia. The content of psilocybin was found to vary over a concentration range of 59.3 to 167.8 µg per 100 mg of fresh sclerotia.",,,Drug Testing and Analysis,,Wiley,"1942-7603, 1942-7611","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Hallucinogens; Limit of Detection; Psilocybe; Psilocybin; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Time Factors",09/08/2012,2012,09/08/2012,2013-03,5,3,182-185,Closed,Article,"Pellegrini, Manuela; Rotolo, Maria Concetta; Marchei, Emilia; Pacifici, Roberta; Saggio, Francesco; Pichini, Simona","Pellegrini, Manuela (Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy); Rotolo, Maria Concetta (Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy); Marchei, Emilia (Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy); Pacifici, Roberta (Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy); Saggio, Francesco (Comando Carabinieri per la Tutela della Salute, Rome, Italy); Pichini, Simona (Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy)","Pichini, Simona (Istituto Superiore di Sanità)","Pellegrini, Manuela (Istituto Superiore di Sanità); Rotolo, Maria Concetta (Istituto Superiore di Sanità); Marchei, Emilia (Istituto Superiore di Sanità); Pacifici, Roberta (Istituto Superiore di Sanità); Saggio, Francesco (); Pichini, Simona (Istituto Superiore di Sanità)",Istituto Superiore di Sanità,grid.416651.1,Rome,,Italy,,,,,,10,6,0.3,1.36,8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015158049,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

These fungi are classified as Psilocybe, Gymnopilus, and Panaeolus which contain active principles with hallucinogenic properties such as ibotenic acid, psilocybin, psilocin, or baeocystin. In Chile, fungi seizures are mainly of mature specimens or spores. However, clandestine laboratories have been found that process fungus samples at the mycelium stage. In this transient stage of growth (mycelium), traditional taxonomic identification is not feasible, making it necessary to develop a new method of study. Currently, DNA analysis is the only reliable method that can be used as an identification tool for the purposes of supporting evidence, due to the high variability of DNA between species. One way to identify the species of a distinctive DNA fragment is to study PCR products analyzed by real time PCR and sequencing. One of the most popular sequencing methods of forensic interest at the generic and intra-generic levels in plants is internal transcribed spacer (ITS). With real time PCR it is possible to distinguish PCR products by differential analysis of their melting temperature (Tm) curves. This paper describes morphological, chemical, and genetic analysis of mycelia of psychedelic fungi collected from a clandestine laboratory. The fungus species were identified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mass spectrometry, HRM analysis, and ITS sequencing. The sporological studies showed a generally smooth surface and oval shape, with maximum length 10.1 μm and width 6.4 μm. The alkaloid Psilocyn was identified by mass spectrometry, while HRM analysis and ITS sequencing identified the species as Psilocybe cubensis. A genetic match was confirmed between the HRM curves obtained from the mycelia (evidence) and biological tissue extracted from the fruiting bodies. Mycelia recovered from the evidence and fruiting bodies (control) were genetically indistinguishable.","Acknowledgements This project #2017PRO-LA-02 was funded by Dirección de Investigación of Universidad Católica de Temuco.

DATA SOURCE: Data sources from observation studies conducted over the period 1959-2002, and describing 28,018 mushroom poisonings since 1951, were collected from case reports, case series, regional descriptive studies, meta-analyses, and laboratory studies of mushroom poisonings and the toxicokinetics of mycotoxins.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies included in the review were selected by a MEDLINE search, 1966-2004, an Ovid OLDMEDLINE search, 1951-1965, and a medical library search for sources published before 1951.
DATA EXTRACTION: To better guide clinicians in establishing diagnoses and implementing therapies, despite confusing ingestion histories, data were extracted to permit an expanded syndromic classification of mushroom poisoning based on presentation timing and target organ systemic toxicity.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The final 14 major syndromes of mushroom poisoning were stratified first by presentation timing and then by target organ systemic toxicity and included early (<6 hrs), late (6-24 hrs), and delayed syndromes (> or =1 day). There were eight early syndromes (four neurotoxic, two gastrointestinal, two allergic); three late syndromes (hepatotoxic, accelerated nephrotoxic, erythromelalgia); and three delayed syndromes (delayed nephrotoxic, delayed neurotoxic, rhabdomyolysis). Four new mushroom poisoning syndromes were classified including accelerated nephrotoxicity (Amanita proxima, Amanita smithiana), rhabdomyolysis (Tricholoma equestre, Russula subnigricans), erythromelalgia (Clitocybe amoenolens, Clitocybe acromelalgia), and delayed neurotoxicity (Hapalopilus rutilans). In addition, data sources were stratified by three chronological time periods with >1,000 confirmed mushroom ingestions reported and tested for any statistically significant secular trends in case fatalities from mushroom ingestions over the entire study period, 1951-2002.
CONCLUSIONS: Since the 1950s, reports of severe and fatal mushroom poisonings have increased worldwide. Clinicians must consider mushroom poisoning in the evaluation of all patients who may be intoxicated by natural substances. Since information on natural exposures is often insufficient and incorrect, a new syndromic classification of mushroom poisoning is recommended to guide clinicians in making earlier diagnoses, especially in cases where only advanced critical care, including organ transplantation, may be life saving.",,,Critical Care Medicine,,Wolters Kluwer,"0090-3493, 1530-0293",Agaricales; Humans; Mushroom Poisoning; Syndrome,2005-02,2005,,2005-02,33,2,427-436,Closed,Article,"Diaz, James H","Diaz, James H (Programs in Community Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. jdiaz@lsuhsc.edu)",,"Diaz, James H (Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans)",Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans,grid.279863.1,New Orleans,Louisiana,United States,,,,,,114,18,2.69,19.36,12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005026157,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

The present paper is an updated redraft of the review, written to support the assessment by CAM experts. It summarizes the literature on physical or psychological dependence, acute and chronic toxicity, risk for public health and criminal aspects related to the consumption of magic mushrooms. In the Netherlands, the prevalence of magic mushroom use was declining since 2000 (last year prevalence of 6.3% in 2000 to 2.9% in 2005), and further declined after possession and use became illegal in December 2008. The CAM concluded that the physical and psychological dependence potential of magic mushrooms was low, that acute toxicity was moderate, chronic toxicity low and public health and criminal aspects negligible. The combined use of mushrooms and alcohol and the quality of the setting in which magic mushrooms are used deserve, however, attention. In conclusion, the use of magic mushrooms is relatively safe as only few and relatively mild adverse effects have been reported. The low prevalent but unpredictable provocation of panic attacks and flash-backs remain, however, a point of concern.","The present study was supported by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports.",,Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology,,Elsevier,"0273-2300, 1096-0295","Accidents; Agaricales; Animals; Hallucinogens; Humans; Netherlands; Panic Disorder; Psilocybin; Psychoses, Substance-Induced; Risk Assessment; Substance-Related Disorders",21/01/2011,2011,21/01/2011,2011-04,59,3,423-429,Closed,Article,"van Amsterdam, Jan; Opperhuizen, Antoon; van den Brink, Wim","van Amsterdam, Jan (Laboratory for Health Protection Research, RIVM, P.O.

Secession modes, coiling of the conidiogenous hyphae or the swelling of the conidia were additional distinguishing features. Phylogenetic analysis of the D1-D3 domains of the nuclear gene for the ribosomal large subunit using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach resulted in several well-supported groups that are consistent with anamorph morphology.

Since June 6, 2002, these fungi have been regulated by the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law in Japan. Because there are many kinds of MMs and they are sold even as dry powders in local markets, it is very difficult to identify the original species of the MMs by morphological observation. Therefore, we investigated the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region in the ribosomal RNA gene of MMs obtained in Japanese markets to classify them by a genetic approach. Based on the size and nucleotide sequence of the ITS region amplified by PCR, tested MMs were classified into 6 groups. Furthermore, a comparison of the DNA sequences of the MMs with those of authentic samples or with those found in the databases (GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ) made it possible to identify the species of tested MMs. Analysis by LC revealed that psilocin (1) was contained at the highest level in Panaeolus cyanescens among the MMs, but was absent in the Amanita species.",,,Shokuhin Eiseigaku Zasshi,,Japanese Society for Food Hygiene and Safety,"0015-6426, 1882-1006","Agaricales; Base Sequence; DNA, Intergenic; Hallucinogens; Psilocybin",2003,2003,,2003,44,1,44,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Maruyama, Takuro; Shirota, Osamu; Kawahara, Nobuo; Yokoyama, Kazumasa; Makino, Yukiko; Goda, Yukihiro","Maruyama, Takuro (National Institute of Health Sciences: 1-18-1, Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.); Shirota, Osamu (); Kawahara, Nobuo (); Yokoyama, Kazumasa (); Makino, Yukiko (); Goda, Yukihiro ()",,"Maruyama, Takuro (National Institute of Health Sciences); Shirota, Osamu (); Kawahara, Nobuo (); Yokoyama, Kazumasa (); Makino, Yukiko (); Goda, Yukihiro ()",National Institute of Health Sciences,grid.410797.c,Tokyo,,Japan,,,,,,11,2,0.35,0.67,3,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/shokueishi/44/1/44_1_44/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008112237,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,Genetics,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

Identification of Psilocybe semilanceata by PCR.,"Psilocybe semilanceata belongs to the genus of Psilocybe; it is a hallucinogenic fungus, frequently found in regions with high rainfall, in the grass and moss. There are estimated to be as many as eight Psilocybe hallucinogenic species containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as psilocybin and psilocin, which may cause visual, auditory and other hallucinations, as well as profound changes in the perception of time and space. Since identification of P semilanceata in a form different than a fresh mushroom is almost impossible, the authors made an attempt at developing a method of fungi identification based on the PCR technique, which could be helpful in a fight against dangerous consumption of these hallucinogens by the youth. Detection of the specific DNA sequence for P semilanceata brought good results; the test may be commonly employed in forensic practice in the future.",,,Archiwum Medycyny Sądowej i Kryminologii,,,"0324-8267, 1689-1716","Agaricales; Drug and Narcotic Control; Hallucinogens; Humans; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Psilocybin; Substance Abuse Detection; Substance-Related Disorders; Toxicology",2007,2007,,2007,57,3,285-8,Closed,Article,"Adamczyk, Aldona; Sadakierska-Chudy, Anna; Janoszka, Jerzy; Rymkiewicz, Apoloniusz; Dobosz, Tadeusz","Adamczyk, Aldona (Z Katedry Medycyny Sadowej i Zakładu Technik Molekularnych Akademii Medycznej we Wrocławiu K ierownik: dr hab.

Lake and mire sediments, soils, and the deposits accumulating in archaeological features, invariably contain plant and fungal remains, particularly pollen and spores. These serve as proxy indicators of ancient environmental conditions and events. Forensic palynology has been successfully employed in criminal investigations for more than two decades. In recent years, it has included fungal palynomorphs in profiling samples from crime scenes, and from exhibits obtained from suspects and victims. This contribution outlines the main features of palynology, and gives examples of case studies where fungal spores, pollen, and plant spores, have enhanced the interpretation of ancient landscapes and land-use, and provided pivotal intelligence, and probative evidence, in criminal investigations.","I am grateful to the many scientific colleagues, archaeologists, and police officers, with whom I have worked over the years, and with whom I have shared information, ideas, arguments, and discussions.

The proposed conditions optimized for the hydrolysis are as follows: hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis; enzyme, Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (5000 units/ml urine); incubation, pH 6 at 37 degrees C for 2h. The complete hydrolysis of PCG in urine was obtained under these conditions, while the enzymatic hydrolyses with three types of beta-glucuronidases originated from bovine liver (Type B-1), Helix pomatia (Type H-1) and Ampullaria provided uncompleted hydrolysis of PCG.

Humans may become symptomatic after a mushroom meal for rather different reasons: (1) ingestion of mushrooms containing toxins, (2) large amounts of mushrooms may be hard to digest, (3) immunological reactions to mushroom-derived antigens, (4) ingestion of mushrooms causing ethanol intolerance, and (5) vegetative symptoms may occur whenever a patient realizes that there might be a possibility of ingestion of a toxic mushroom after a mushroom meal. Based on the classes of toxins and their clinical symptoms, seven different types of mushroom poisoning can be distinguished: (1) phalloides, (2) orellanus, (3) gyromitra, (4) muscarine, (5) pantherina, (6) psilocybin, and (7) gastrointestinal mushroom syndrome. Two other entities of adverse reactions to mushrooms are (8) coprinus and (9) paxillus syndrome. Phalloides, orellanus, gyromitra and paxillus syndrome may lead to serious poisoning, which generally requires treatment of the patient in an intensive care unit. Diagnosis of mushroom poisoning is primarily based on anamnestic data, identification of mushrooms from leftovers of the mushroom meal, spore analysis, and/or chemical analysis. Therapeutic strategies include primary detoxification by induced emesis, gastric lavage and activated charcoal, secondary detoxification, symptomatic treatment and rarely specific antidotes. Owing to progressing fulminant hepatic failure, lethality associated with phalloides syndrome is still high (5-20%). Basic treatment includes administration of silibinin and penicillin G, although controlled studies on its therapeutic efficacy are still lacking.

It aims to challenge some of the mainstream narratives about drug markets and to identify features of this specific market, which will extend our understanding of how illegal drug markets operate and are structured more generally.
METHODS: The research presented comprises a three year ethnography of sites of magic mushroom production in rural Kent. Observations were conducted at 5 research sites over three consecutive magic mushroom seasons and interviews were conducted with 10 (8 male; 2 female) key informants.
RESULTS: It finds that naturally occurring magic mushroom sites are reluctant and liminal sites of drug production, distinct from other Class-A drug production sites due to their: open and accessible nature; lack of invested ownership or evidence of purposeful cultivation; and lack of law enforcement disruption efforts, violence or organised crime involvement. Seasonal magic mushroom picker participants were found to be a sociable group, often acting in a cooperative nature, and without evidence of territoriality or violent dispute resolution. These findings have wider application in challenging the dominant narrative that the most harmful (Class-A) drug markets are homogenous in their violent, profit driven, hierarchical nature, and most Class-A drug producers/suppliers are morally corrupt, financially motivated and organised.
CONCLUSION: A greater understanding of the variety of Class-A drug markets in operation can challenge archetypes and discrimination in understanding drug market involvement, will allow the development of more nuanced policing and policy strategies, and contributes to the presentation of a fluidity of drug market structure that permeates beyond bottom level street markets or social supply.",Declarations of Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This research received funding from the following sources The empirical data on which this article is partly based was funded as part of an ESRC 3+1 scholarship: 18906858.,International Journal of Drug Policy,,Elsevier,"0955-3959, 1873-4758",Humans; Male; Female; Seasons; Psilocybe; Illicit Drugs; Crime,28/02/2023,2023,28/02/2023,2023-04,114,,103973,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Simpson, George Henry Robert; Chatwin, Caroline; van Hellemont, Elke","Simpson, George Henry Robert (Law Society and Social Justice, University of Kent, Giles Lane, Canterbury, Kent, CT2 7NF, United Kingdom.); Chatwin, Caroline (Law Society and Social Justice, University of Kent, Giles Lane, Canterbury, Kent, CT2 7NF, United Kingdom.

In our republic, several species of Psilocybe with a high content of these components can be found. In the present study, we give a semiquantitative content of psilocin and psilocybin in some of our mushrooms in dry substance (Psilocybe semilanceata, Psilocybe bohemica, Psilocybe arcana, Psilocybe cyanescens, Panaeolus acuminatus sensu Ricken, Inocybe haemacta and Pluteus salicinus). For quantification, the GC/MS instrumentation was applied. Psilocin and psilocybin were silylated by the derivatization agent N-methyl-N-trimet-hylsilyltrifluoroacetamide. As an internal standard, 5-methoxytryptamin was used. The results of this study prove the presence of at least three species of Psilocybe with a high content of psychoactive components growing in our republic: Psilocybe semilanceata, Psilocybe bohemica and Psilocybe arcana.",,,Cesko-Slovenská patologie a soudní lékarství,,,0371-1854,Agaricales; Czech Republic; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Hallucinogens; Psilocybin,2003-07,2003,,2003-07,48,3,45-9,Closed,Article,"Stríbrný, J; Borovicka, J; Sokol, M","Stríbrný, J (Ustav leteckého zdravotnictví, Gen.

They are an important source of nutrition; however, certain varieties contain chemicals that can be highly toxic to humans. Industrially cultivated mushrooms are historically very safe, but foraging for mushrooms or accidental ingestion of mushrooms in the environment can result in serious illness and death. The emergency department is the most common site of presentation for patients suffering from acute mushroom poisoning. Although recognition can be facilitated by identification of a characteristic toxidrome, the presenting manifestations can be variable and have considerable overlap with more common and generally benign clinical syndromes. The goal of this two-part article is to review the knowledge base on this subject and provide information that will assist the clinician in the early consideration, diagnosis and treatment of mushroom poisoning. Part I, presented in this issue of the Journal, reviews the epidemiology and demographics of mushroom poisoning, the physical characteristics of the most toxic varieties, the classification of the toxic species, and an overview of the cyclopeptide-containing mushroom class.

METHODS: We surveyed 882 randomly selected undergraduates at Skidmore College in upstate New York and quantified whether participants had ever used psilocybin mushrooms, their attitudes toward the drug, and polydrug use.
RESULTS: There were 409 responses and 29.5% of the sample reported psilocybin use. Among users, the mean number of times they reported using mushrooms was 3.4 (mode=1). The top factors cited that influenced their decisions to try hallucinogenic mushrooms for the first time were 'curiosity', 'to achieve a mystical experience', and 'introspection'. Users and non-users had significantly different perceptions of mushrooms: non-users were more likely to say that hallucinogenic mushrooms were addictive and had the potential for abuse than users. Users did not believe that psilocybin negatively impacts their academics, mental health, or physical health, while non-users did. Both users and non-users of psilocybin reported high life-time use of alcohol (97% vs 96%, respectively), marijuana (98% vs 73%, respectively) and tobacco (82% vs 54%, respectively). Psilocybin users were significantly more likely to use other drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, opiates, non-prescribed prescription drugs, opiates, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) than non-users of psilocybin.

Psychedelic research could potentially benefit from the integration of metabonomics by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy which is an analytical chemistry-based approach that can measure the breakdown of drugs into their metabolites and their metabolic consequences from various biofluids. We have performed a systematic review with the primary aim of exploring published literature where 1H NMR analysed psychedelic substances including psilocin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), LSD derivatives, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and bufotenin. The second aim was to assess the benefits and limitations of 1H NMR spectroscopy-based metabolomics as a tool in psychedelic research and the final aim was to explore potential future directions. We found that the most current use of 1H NMR in psychedelic research has been for the structural elucidation and analytical characterisation of psychedelic molecules and that no papers used 1H NMR in the metabolic profiling of biofluids, thus exposing a current research gap and the underuse of 1H NMR. The efficacy of 1H NMR spectroscopy was also compared to mass spectrometry, where both metabonomics techniques have previously shown to be appropriate for biofluid analysis in other applications. Additionally, potential future directions for psychedelic research were identified as real-time NMR, in vivo 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 1H NMR studies of the gut microbiome. Further psychedelic studies need to be conducted that incorporate the use of 1H NMR spectroscopy in the analysis of metabolites both in the peripheral biofluids and in vivo to determine whether it will be an effective future approach for clinical and naturalistic research.",,"Work in the JG laboratory is supported by the Medical Research Council (MR/P011705/1 and MR/S010483/1) and the Dementia Research Institute (UKDRI-5002).

Nevertheless, accidental consumption of poisonous mushrooms that results in fatality or severe illness is typical in all countries, especially among the tribal indigenous communities that forage wild mushrooms for food. In the Indian subcontinent, mushroom poisoning cases are underreported and neglected. Different classes of toxins, characterized from the poisonous mushrooms found globally, show variable clinical symptoms post-consumption. Although the Indian subcontinent is a biodiversity hotspot and home to different classes of fungi and mushrooms, many species of poisonous mushrooms and their toxins, have yet to be identified and characterized. No epidemiological studies or retrospective analyses of mushroom poisoning cases have been reported from the poison control centers in the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, some limited clinical and epidemiological data is available from India and Nepal, and therefore, we critically analyse the mushroom poisoning scenario in these countries, and discuss the mushroom toxins that are likely responsible for the post-ingestion toxicities. We also correlate the clinical manifestations of mushroom intoxication in India and Nepal with the pharmacological properties of the prevalent mushroom toxins in these countries. Our limited study of mushroom poisoning demonstrates that the adverse pharmacological effects of amatoxin, one of the deadliest mushroom toxins, are responsible for the highest mortality and morbidity in India and Nepal. Further, no specific antidote is available to treat mushroom intoxication in the region, and systemic and supportive care is all that is available for in-patient management of cases of severe poisoning. We also suggest a roadmap for the prevention and specific treatment against mushroom poisoning in the Indian subcontinent.","The authors thank Dr. Glen D.

Although commonly abused drugs can be identified during routine urine drug testing, less commonly abused drugs may escape detection. These less commonly abused drugs not only include some designer drugs such as synthetic cannabinoid but also include abuse of psychedelic magic mushroom (active ingredients: psilocybin and psilocin), peyote cactus (active ingredient: mescaline), and khat plants (active ingredient: cathinone). Moreover, solvent and glue abuse is gaining popularity among teenagers and young adults which may even cause fatality. Amphetamine/methamphetamine immunoassay has a low cross-reactivity with psilocin. Cathinone, if present in the urine, can be detected by amphetamine/methamphetamine immunoassay due to cross-reactivity of cathinone with assay antibody. Currently there is one commercially available immunoassay which is capable of detecting synthetic cathinone known as bath salts as well as mescaline. However, gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry as well as liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)-based method is available for confirmation of the active ingredients present in magic mushroom, peyote cactus, and khat plant.

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of mushroom poisoning in Ireland, to describe the working arrangement between the National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC) and professional mycologists and to present a case series detailing the circumstances when mycologists were consulted.
METHODS: Computerised records from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and data on patient demographics, circumstances, and mushroom species collated. In 1999, the NPIC established a national registry of volunteer professional mycologists who are available 24 h/day for mushroom identification. The NPIC staff liaises directly with the mycologist and arranges transport of mushroom material. Digital photographic images are requested if there is likely to be a delay in arranging transportation of mushroom material, and the images are subsequently emailed to a mycologist. Five cases of suspected mushroom poisoning were chosen to demonstrate the inter-professional collaboration between the NPIC and mycologists.
RESULTS: From 2004 to 2009, the NPIC was consulted about 70 cases of suspected mushroom exposures. Forty-five children ingested unknown mushrooms, 12 adults and 2 children ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms and 11 adults ingested wild toxic mushrooms that were incorrectly identified or confused with edible species. The mycologists were consulted 10 times since 1999. In this series, Amanita species were identified in two cases. In three cases, the species identified were Clitocybe nebularis, Coprinus comatus and Panaeolina foenisecii, respectively, and serious poisoning was excluded. Incorrect mushroom identification by a health care professional using the Internet occurred in two cases. The mycologists assisted Poisons Information Centres in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom in two cases. Digital photographs facilitated tentative mushroom identification in two cases.
CONCLUSION: Poison information centres should maintain a registry of expert mycologists who are available for consultation following potentially serious mushroom intoxications. Health care workers should not attempt to identify toxic mushroom species using the Internet as erroneous identification can occur. Digital photography may help with mushroom identification when there is likely to be a delay organising a physical examination of mushroom tissue.","The authors would like to acknowledge Mr Hubert Fuller for critical evaluation of the manuscript.

Correct identification of the species is difficult for laypersons. Ingestion of toxic mushrooms may result in serious toxicity, including death. The aim of the study is to analyze and describe the circumstances of exposure to mushrooms, and to define the clinical relevance of mushroom poisoning for humans in Central Europe.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective case study and analyzed all inquiries concerning human exposures to mushrooms (n = 5638, 1.2% of all inquiries) which were reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre between January 1995 and December 2009.
RESULTS: The most frequent reason for contacting the poison center in cases of adult exposure was toxicity resulting from edible species. Pediatric exposure predominantly occurred from mushrooms found around the home. Severe symptoms have not only been observed after ingestion of non-amatoxin-containing toxic mushrooms, i.e. Boletus sp. and Cortinarius sp., but also after meals of edible species. The mortality of confirmed amatoxin poisonings was high (5/32) compared to other reports.
CONCLUSIONS: Inquiries regarding mushroom poisoning were a relatively infrequent reason for contacting the poison center. Nevertheless, accidental ingestion of toxic mushrooms can be responsible for severe or fatal poisonings. Although pediatric exposure to mushrooms found around the home has not led to serious toxicity in this study, prevention of exposure is warranted.

It differs from classic serotonergic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocin in both phenomenology and potent agonist activity of the active component salvinorin A at κ-opioid receptors. Awareness of S. divinorum has grown recently, with both an increase in its public representation and concern over its potential harmful effects. This discussion is particularly relevant as S. divinorum is legal to use in many countries and regions and easily available through online retailers. Drawing upon previous investigations of S. divinorum and other hallucinogens, this study surveyed 154 recent users and questioned them on their use behaviours, consequences of use and other attitudinal measures. Although reporting an extensive substance use history, and considering the limitations of online surveys, there was little evidence of dysfunctional S. divinorum use, and few reports of troubling adverse consequences of use. Furthermore, there was no evidence that users exhibited increased schizotypy. Respondents reported that S. divinorum produced mixed hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, which lends support to assertions that it phenomenologically differs from other hallucinogens with primary serotonergic activity. The functions of use changed with greater experiences with the drug, and although many respondents reported use of S. divinorum as an alternative to illegal drugs it, was apparent that legal proscription would be unlikely to dissuade them from use. These results are discussed with reference to psychopharmacologically informed public health responses to substance use.",,,Journal of Psychopharmacology,,SAGE Publications,"0269-8811, 1461-7285","Camphanes; Data Collection; Diterpenes, Clerodane; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Hallucinogens; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Internet; Male; Panax notoginseng; Public Health; Receptors, Opioid, kappa; Salvia; Salvia miltiorrhiza; Young Adult",11/10/2010,2010,11/10/2010,2011-11,25,11,1496-1507,Closed,Article,"Sumnall, HR; Measham, F; Brandt, SD; Cole, JC","Sumnall, HR (Centre for Public Health, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK.); Measham, F (Department of Applied Social Science, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.); Brandt, SD (School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK.); Cole, JC (School of Psychology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.)","Sumnall, HR (Liverpool John Moores University)","Sumnall, HR (Liverpool John Moores University); Measham, F (Lancaster University); Brandt, SD (Liverpool John Moores University); Cole, JC (University of Liverpool)",Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool; Lancaster University,grid.4425.7; grid.10025.36; grid.9835.7,Liverpool; Liverpool; Lancaster,; ; Lancashire,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,,,,,,30,5,0.85,3.71,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019518245,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Substance Misuse,Generic health relevance,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

The nephrotoxicity of Cortinarius orellanus is well known and was first recognized in the 1950s when this mushroom was identified as the cause of a mass poisoning in Poland. Typically, onset of symptoms is delayed for 1-2 weeks after ingestion. Some patients suffer mild gastrointestinal discomfort in the latency period before developing signs of renal impairment due to severe interstitial nephritis, acute focal tubular damage, and interstitial fibrosis. There is no specific antidote to orellanine poisoning.

The manifestations of mushroom poisoning (MP) may vary. Some species have been reported as rhabdomyolytic, hallucinogenic, or gastrointestinal poisons. Critical or even fatal MPs are mostly attributable to Amanita phalloides, with the development of severe liver or renal failure. Myocardial injury and even cases mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been previously reported, while cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest is not commonly seen.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a 68-year-old woman with MP who suffered from delirium, seizure, long QT syndrome on electrocardiogram (ECG), severe cardiac arrhythmias of multiple origins, and cardiac arrest. She was intubated and put on blood perfusion. Her kidney and liver functions were intact; creatine kinase-MB was mildly elevated, and then fell within normal range during her hospital stay. We sent the mushrooms she left for translation elongation factor subunit 1α, ribosomal RNA gene sequence, and internal transcribed spacer sequence analyses. There were four kinds of mushrooms identified, two of which were found to be toxic.
CONCLUSION: This is the first time that we found cardiac toxicity caused by Panaeolus subbalteatus and Conocybe lactea, which were believed to be toxic to the liver, kidney, and brain. We suggest that intensive monitoring and ECG follow-up are essential to diagnose prolonged QT interval and different forms of tachycardia in MP patients, even without the development of severe liver or renal failure.

However, by mass spectrometry we detected N-glycans and O-glycans containing one to six deoxyhexose residues in fruit bodies of several basidiomycetes. The N-glycans of chanterelles (Cantharellus cibarius) contained a deoxyhexose chromatographically identical to fucose and sensitive to α-L-fucosidase. Analysis of individual glycan species by tandem MS, glycosidase digestion, and finally (1)H NMR revealed the presence of L-fucose in α1,6-linkage to an α1,6-mannose of oligomannosidic N-glycans. The substitution by α1,6-mannose of α1,2-mannosyl residues of the canonical precursor structure was yet another hitherto unknown modification. No indication for the occurrence of yet other modifications, e.g. bisecting N-acetylglucosamine, was seen. Besides fucosylated N-glycans, short O-linked mannan chains substituted with fucose were present on chanterelle proteins. Although undiscovered so far, L-fucose appears to represent a prominent feature of protein-linked glycans in the fungal kingdom.","We thank Karin Polacsek and Karin Hofbauer for helping with the purification of PA-labeled N-glycans and Dr. Ebrahim Razzazi-Fazeli (University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria) for assistance with MALDI-TOF MS.",,Journal of Biological Chemistry,,Elsevier,"0021-9258, 1083-351X",Basidiomycota; Carbohydrate Conformation; Fucose; Mannose; Mass Spectrometry; Oligosaccharides; Polysaccharides; alpha-L-Fucosidase,17/12/2010,2010,17/12/2010,2011-02,286,8,5977-5984,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Grass, Josephine; Pabst, Martin; Kolarich, Daniel; Pöltl, Gerald; Léonard, Renaud; Brecker, Lothar; Altmann, Friedrich","Grass, Josephine (Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190 Vienna, Austria); Pabst, Martin (Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190 Vienna, Austria); Kolarich, Daniel (Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190 Vienna, Austria); Pöltl, Gerald (Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190 Vienna, Austria); Léonard, Renaud (Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190 Vienna, Austria); Brecker, Lothar (Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria); Altmann, Friedrich (Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, 1190 Vienna, Austria)","Altmann, Friedrich (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences)","Grass, Josephine (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences); Pabst, Martin (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences); Kolarich, Daniel (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences); Pöltl, Gerald (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences); Léonard, Renaud (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences); Brecker, Lothar (University of Vienna); Altmann, Friedrich (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences)",University of Vienna; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences,grid.10420.37; grid.5173.0,Vienna; Vienna,; ,Austria; Austria,,,,,,29,7,0.94,2.59,3,http://www.jbc.org/content/286/8/5977.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035072000,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Some mushrooms are popular worldwide for their nutritional and therapeutic properties. However, some species are dangerous because they cause toxicity. There are many reports explaining the medicinal and/or toxic effects of these fungal species. Cases of serious human poisoning generally caused by the improper identification of toxic mushroom species are reported every year. Different substances responsible for the fatal signs and symptoms of mushroom toxicity have been identified from various poisonous mushrooms. Toxicity studies of mushroom species have demonstrated that mushroom poisoning can cause adverse effects such as liver failure, bradycardia, chest pain, seizures, gastroenteritis, intestinal fibrosis, renal failure, erythromelalgia, and rhabdomyolysis.

Field observations, interviews and collection of fungi specimens were carried out primarily on two islands, Koh Samui and Koh Pha-ngan, situated in the western region of the Gulf of Siam. Some fieldwork was also conducted in the northern Thai province of Chiang Dao and in the southern Thai province of Surat Thani. During five separate excursions (1989-90), observations were made of occurrence, harvesting, use, and marketing of psychoactive fungi by local Thai natives (males and females, adults and children), foreign tourists, and German immigrants. The first records of psychoactive Psilocybe subcubensis and Copelandia dung fungi in Thailand are presented in this paper. These fungi exhibited intense bluing reactions when handled, indicating the presence of psilocybin and/or psilocin. Seven collections of Psilocybe cubensis (Earle) Singer and/or Psilocybe subcubensis Guzman and four collections of Copelandia sp. were harvested and sun-dried for herbarium deposit. These fungi are cultivated or occur spontaneously, often appearing in the decomposed manure of domesticated water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and at least three different species of cattle (Bos indicus, B. guarus, and B. sundaicus). The psychoactive fungi are cultivated in clandestine plots, both indoors and outdoors, in the uplands and villages on Koh Samui by both Thai natives and some foreigners. The sale of psychoactive fungi directly to tourists and to resort restaurants for use in edible food items such as omelettes and soups is discussed in detail.

Most have effects similar to those of more popular synthetic drugs but can cause unpleasant side effects and unpredictable results. Identification of the offending botanic agent can be problematic. These plants are still used because most are legal to possess, and they do produce desired hallucinogenic and stimulant effects. Because the active ingredients are similar pharmacologically to agents such as LSD and amphetamine, required treatment is often similar. The challenge for the Emergency Department physician is to recognize the potential for abuse of these botanic agents, their probable side effects, and the need for appropriate, usually supportive, treatment.

A half century ago, psychedelics were widely employed by psychiatrists in investigational and clinical settings, with studies demonstrating promising findings for their use in the treatment of mental illness and substance use disorders. However, concerns were also raised about their abuse potential and other adverse effects. Owing to these worries and psychedelics' association with the counterculture movement, psychedelics were largely outlawed in the United States in 1970, bringing research on their therapeutic potential to a halt. However, in recent years, a resurgence of psychedelic research has revealed compelling, though early, evidence for the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy in treating alcohol use disorder, nicotine use disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression.
OBJECTIVE: Here we provide an overview of psychiatry's complicated relationship with psychedelics, while reviewing contemporary findings on psychedelic-assisted therapy, safety of psychedelic-assisted therapy, and risks of nonmedical use. We also make the case that psychiatry should consider preparing now for the possibility of Food and Drug Administration approval of psychedelic-assisted therapies in the near future. We conclude by discussing how growing societal interest in psychedelics could impact the work of consult-liaison psychiatrists, while also exploring how consult-liaison psychiatrists might contribute to future delivery of psychedelic treatments.
METHODS: We reviewed literature on psychedelic-assisted therapies and adverse events resulting from nonmedical psychedelic use.
RESULTS: We found a small, but rapidly growing literature indicating that psychedelic-assisted therapies may have treatment potential for mental illness and addiction. Our search also revealed a variety of rare adverse events stemming from nonmedical psychedelic use.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite past concerns about psychedelics, current data indicate psychedelic-assisted therapy may potentially reduce suffering owing to mental illness and addiction if administered thoughtfully and cautiously by trained professionals in medical settings.",,Funding: This study was not funded.,Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry,,Elsevier,"2667-2979, 2667-2960","Hallucinogens; Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; Psilocybin; Psychiatry; United States",21/01/2021,2021,21/01/2021,2021-07,62,4,460-471,Closed,Article,"Barnett, Brian S; Greer, George R","Barnett, Brian S (Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Center for Behavioral Health, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.

Despite raising awareness of poisonous mushrooms in the Polish society, year after year hospitals treat many patients diagnosed with poisoning with the most common toxic species of mushroom found in our country. Furthermore, growing interest in hallucinogenic mushrooms among young people has become a serious medical problem of our time. Websites make it incredibly easy for people to obtain information on the morphology and appearance of mushrooms with psychoactive properties, which leads inexperienced pickers to misidentification, resulting frequently in a fatal outcome. The article explores the subject of poisoning with the most common mushrooms with neurotropic effects, these are: Amanita muscaria, Amanita pantherina, Inocybe rubescens, Clitocybe dealbata, Clitocybe rivulosa and Psilocybe semilanceata. Toxins found in these species show symptoms that affect the central nervous system, parasympathetic system as well as the gastro-intestinal system. The effects of poisoning in the mushroom species mentioned above are mild in general, liver and kidney damage occur rarely, but the symptoms depend on both the dosage of the consumed toxins and individual susceptibility. In most cases the treatment is of symptomatic nature. There is no specific treatment. Medical procedures mainly involve induced gastrolavage--stomach pumping (providing that the patient is conscious), prescription of active carbon as well as replacement of lost body fluids and electrolytes. If the muscarinic symptoms prevail it is generally advised to dose atropine. Patients showing the signs of hyperactivity receive tranquilizers or narcoleptics to eliminate psychotic symptoms.",,,Medycyna Pracy,,,"0465-5893, 2353-1339",Agaricales; Agaricus; Amanita; Gastric Lavage; Hallucinogens; Humans; Mushroom Poisoning; Poland; Psilocybe; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult,2010,2010,,2010,61,5,583-95,Closed,Article,"Marciniak, Beata; Ferenc, Tomasz; Kusowska, Joanna; Ciećwierz, Julita; Kowalczyk, Edward","Marciniak, Beata (Zakład Biologii i Genetyki Medycznej Katedry Biomedycznych Podstaw Fizjoterapii, Uniwersytet Medyczny, Łódź.); Ferenc, Tomasz (); Kusowska, Joanna (); Ciećwierz, Julita (); Kowalczyk, Edward ()",,"Marciniak, Beata (); Ferenc, Tomasz (); Kusowska, Joanna (); Ciećwierz, Julita (); Kowalczyk, Edward ()",,,,,,,,,,,9,1,0.25,1.72,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078352872,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,Brain Disorders; Digestive Diseases; Neurosciences,,,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",

The sample consists of 877 homobasidiomycete taxa and includes approximately one tenth (ca. 700 species) of the known number of species of gilled mushrooms that were traditionally classified in the order Agaricales. About 1000 nucleotide sequences at the 5(') end of the nuclear large ribosomal subunit gene (nLSU) were produced for each taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequence data employed unequally weighted parsimony and bootstrap methods. Clades revealed by the analyses support the recognition of eight major groups of homobasidiomycetes that cut across traditional lines of classification, in agreement with other recent phylogenetic studies. Gilled fungi comprise the majority of species in the euagarics clade. However, the recognition of a monophyletic euagarics results in the exclusion from the clade of several groups of gilled fungi that have been traditionally classified in the Agaricales and necessitates the inclusion of several clavaroid, poroid, secotioid, gasteroid, and reduced forms that were traditionally classified in other basidiomycete orders. A total of 117 monophyletic groups (clades) of euagarics can be recognized on the basis on nLSU phylogeny. Though many clades correspond to traditional taxonomic groups, many do not. Newly discovered phylogenetic affinities include for instance relationships of the true puffballs (Lycoperdales) with Agaricaceae, of Panellus and the poroid fungi Dictyopanus and Favolaschia with Mycena, and of the reduced fungus Caripia with Gymnopus. Several clades are best supported by ecological, biochemical, or trophic habits rather than by morphological similarities.","The authors are grateful to the following persons who provided material and taxonomic expertise for this study: Duur Aanen, Jean Bérubé, Jacqueline Bonnard, Hal Burdsall, Phillippe Callac, Cony Decock, Dennis Desjardin, Roy Halling, David Hibbett, Terry Henkel, Egon Horak, Omon Isikhuemhen, Rick Kerrigan, Thomas Kuyper, Jean Lodge, Lorelei Norvell, Ursula Peintner, Ron Petersen, Beatrice Senn-Irlet, and Roy Watling.

Pubmed was searched by one doctoral-level researcher using specific Boolean operator terms. The results were filtered by title and abstract and 76 articles were screened and analyzed in full detail. Oral psilocybin is showing itself to be clinically efficacious by producing statistically significant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms over time versus control in multiple clinical trials. It has also been shown to reduce cigarettes per day and drinks per day in patients with substance use disorders. Thus far, there have been no significant adverse clinical events from psilocybin and there also have been no verifiable recorded deaths reported.

Tryptamines currently are not part of typical toxicology testing regimens and their contribution to drug overdoses may be underestimated. Although their prevalence was low, it is increasing. There are few published data on the many new compounds, their mechanisms of action, onset and duration of action, toxicity, signs and symptoms of intoxication and analytical methods to identify tryptamines and their metabolites. We review the published literature and worldwide databases to describe the newest tryptamines, their toxicology, chemical structures and reported overdose cases. Tryptamines are 5-HT2A receptor agonists that produce altered perceptions of reality. Currently, the most prevalent tryptamines are 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DiPT), 5-methoxy-N,N- diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) and dimethyltryptamine (DMT). From 2015 to 2020, 22 new analytical methods were developed to identify/quantify tryptamines and metabolites in biological samples, primarily by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The morbidity accompanying tryptamine intake is considerable and it is critical for clinicians and laboratorians to be informed of the latest data on this public health threat.","The authors thank Laura Martucci, Simonetta di Carlo, Antonella Bacosi and Michele Sciotti for technical assistance.","This research was partially found by the Presidency of Ministers Council, Department of Antidrug Policy.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,MDPI,"1661-6596, 1422-0067","Animals; Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic; Chromatography, Liquid; Humans; Molecular Structure; Psychotropic Drugs; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Toxicity Tests; Tryptamines",04/12/2020,2020,04/12/2020,,21,23,9279,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malaca, Sara; Faro, Alfredo Fabrizio Lo; Tamborra, Alice; Pichini, Simona; Busardò, Francesco Paolo; Huestis, Marilyn A.","Malaca, Sara (Department of Excellence of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University “Politecnica delle Marche” of Ancona, Via Tronto 10, 60126 Ancona, Italy;, smalaca@hotmail.com, (S.M.);, fabriziolofaro09@gmail.com, (A.F.L.F.);, tamborraalice@gmail.com, (A.T.)); Faro, Alfredo Fabrizio Lo (Department of Excellence of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University “Politecnica delle Marche” of Ancona, Via Tronto 10, 60126 Ancona, Italy;, smalaca@hotmail.com, (S.M.);, fabriziolofaro09@gmail.com, (A.F.L.F.);, tamborraalice@gmail.com, (A.T.)); Tamborra, Alice (Department of Excellence of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University “Politecnica delle Marche” of Ancona, Via Tronto 10, 60126 Ancona, Italy;, smalaca@hotmail.com, (S.M.);, fabriziolofaro09@gmail.com, (A.F.L.F.);, tamborraalice@gmail.com, (A.T.)); Pichini, Simona (National Centre on Addiction and Doping, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, V.Le Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy;, simona.pichini@iss.it); Busardò, Francesco Paolo (Department of Excellence of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University “Politecnica delle Marche” of Ancona, Via Tronto 10, 60126 Ancona, Italy;, smalaca@hotmail.com, (S.M.);, fabriziolofaro09@gmail.com, (A.F.L.F.);, tamborraalice@gmail.com, (A.T.)); Huestis, Marilyn A.

In addition, two male patients are reported who showed an acute exacerbation of psychosis after ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms. In addition, a review of the literature is presented.
RESULTS: The khat-induced psychotic symptoms disappeared without any treatment within one week. One of the patients with a psilocybin-induced psychosis was treated with risperidone. In the other, symptomatology subsided in a few days. No somatic medical complications occurred.

To date, bibliometric analysis related to the field of mushroom poisoning has not been published. This study aimed to assess the most significant publications in this field as well as the associated trends and important drivers in the research related to mushroom poisoning. The Scopus database was screened to identify relevant publications on mushroom poisoning. A total of 985 publications with a minimum of five citations were identified and analyzed. Pearson's correlation demonstrated an insignificant weak negative correlation (Pearson's correlation of -0.020, P > 0.01) between the number of years since publication and the number of citation counts of a paper. Bradford's law of scattering revealed that one-third of publications were published in 31 core journals, with Clinical Toxicology topping the list (41 papers). VOSviewer was used to generate a network visualization based on country. The United States was the largest contributor of publications on mushroom poisoning, contributing 19.6% of 985. China is an emerging leader in publications on mushroom poisoning research since 2011, with the most recent average publication year of 2011.18. A term map was also created to visualize the co-occurrence of key terms, whereby Amanita phalloides-related research appeared to be the most frequently published topic in this field.

Recent evidence suggests more than 40% of young people have tried illicit drugs at some time. There are numerous medical consequences to recreational drug use, and a physician should always consider substance abuse in any unexplained illness. The renal complications of drug abuse are also becoming more frequent, and may encompass a spectrum of glomerular, interstitial and vascular diseases. Although some substances are directly nephrotoxic, a number of other mechanisms are also involved. These effects are often chronic and irreversible, but occasionally acute with possible recovery.

Fourteen species capable of growing on dung were identified. Descriptions are given of all dung-inhabiting species and to a lesser extent of the species occasionally growing on dung. Three new species are described: Psathyrella fimiseda, P. merdicola, and P. scatophila. P. stercoraria is described as a new species in order to validate the name. A key to the coprophilous species in Europe including the species described by Peck & Smith from North America is provided. The phylogenetic analyses recovered four major supported clades within Psathyrellaceae corresponding to Parasola, Coprinopsis, Lacrymaria/Spadiceae pro parte, and Psathyrella. The status of Coprinellus was ambiguous. The current morphology-based infrageneric classification of Psathyrella was not supported by the phylogenetic analyses and a coprophilous habit has apparently evolved on multiple occasions. Three new combinations are proposed: Parasola conopilus, Coprinopsis marcescibilis, and Coprinopsis pannucioides.","We express our gratitude to Nils Lundqvist, Svengunnar Ryman, Jacques Melot, and Scott Redhead for advice particularly with Latin and nomenclatural issues.

The existing formulations of prokaryotic l-asparaginase are often toxic and contain l-glutaminase and urease residues, thereby increasing the purification steps. Production of l-glutaminase and urease free l-asparaginase is thus desired. In this research, bioprospecting of isolates from the less explored class Agaricomycetes was undertaken for l-asparaginase production. Plate assay (using phenol red and bromothymol blue dyes) was performed followed by estimation of l-asparaginase, l-glutaminase and urease activities by Nesslerization reaction for all the isolates. The isolate displaying the desired enzyme production was subjected to morphological, molecular identification, and phylogenetic analysis with statistical validation using Jukes-Cantor by Neighbour-joining tree of Maximum Likelihood statistical method. Among the isolates, Ganoderma australe GPC191 with significantly high zone index value (5.581 ± 0.045 at 120 h) and enzyme activity (1.57 ± 0.006 U/mL), devoid of l-glutaminase and urease activity was selected. The present study for the first-time reported G. australe as the potential source of l-glutaminase and urease-free l-asparaginase and also is one of the few studies contributing to the literature of G. australe in India. Hence, it can be postulated that it may find its future application in pharmaceutical and food industries.","The authors wish to extend their sincere gratitude to the management of JAIN Group of Institutions, Bengaluru, India, for providing laboratory facilities required for this research work.

Although traditional addictive substances, such as opium, cannabis and coca, have been controlled by the United Nations anti-drug conventions, many, if not most, natural plants with addictive or abuse liability remain elusive. Therefore, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has warned the emerging threat from new psychoactive substances (NPS), which are mostly derived or modified from the constituents of natural origin. For example, synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones are derived from the cannabis and khat plant, respectively. In this review, we briefly discussed the chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of five common NPS of natural origin, i.e., khat, kratom, salvia, magic mushroom and mandrake. Through the review, we hope that professionals and general public alike can pay more attention to the potential problems caused by natural NPS, and suitable control measures will be taken.","This work was supported in part by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 103-2923-B-037-001-MY2) and Kaohsiung City Government (T105004).","This work was supported in part by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 103-2923-B-037-001-MY2) and Kaohsiung City Government (T105004).",Journal of Food and Drug Analysis,,"The Journal of Food and Drug Analysis (JFDA), Food and Drug Administration, Taiwan (TFDA)","1021-9498, 2224-6614",Alkaloids; Cannabinoids; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Psychotropic Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders,18/04/2017,2017,18/04/2017,2017-07,25,3,461-471,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Feng, Ling-Yi; Battulga, Altansuvd; Han, Eunyoung; Chung, Heesun; Li, Jih-Heng","Feng, Ling-Yi (Ph.D. Program in Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan); Battulga, Altansuvd (School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan); Han, Eunyoung (College of Pharmacy, Duksung Women's University, Seoul, South Korea); Chung, Heesun (Graduate School of Analytical Science and Technology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea); Li, Jih-Heng (Ph.D. Program in Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan)","Chung, Heesun (Chungnam National University); Li, Jih-Heng (Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital)","Feng, Ling-Yi (Kaohsiung Medical University); Battulga, Altansuvd (Kaohsiung Medical University); Han, Eunyoung (Duksung Women's University); Chung, Heesun (Chungnam National University); Li, Jih-Heng (Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital)",Duksung Women's University; Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital; Chungnam National University; Kaohsiung Medical University,grid.410884.1; grid.412027.2; grid.254230.2; grid.412019.f,Seoul; Kaohsiung City; Daejeon; Kaohsiung City,; ; ; ,South Korea; Taiwan; South Korea; Taiwan,Ministry of Science and Technology,,Taiwan,,,55,25,3.18,7.89,1,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfda.2017.04.001,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084900639,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Substance Misuse,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being

To investigate the elimination kinetics of psilocin (PI), the first metabolite of PY, urine was collected for 24 h and PI concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with column switching and electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Sample workup included protection of the unstable PI with ascorbic acid, freeze-drying, and extraction with methanol. Peak PI concentrations up to 870 microg/l were measured in urine samples from the 2-4 h collection interval. The PI excretion rate in this period was 55.5+/-33.8 microg/h. The limit of quantitation (10 microg/L) was usually reached 24 h after drug administration. Within 24 h, 3.4+/-0.9% of the applied dose of PY was excreted as free PI. Addition of beta-glucuronidase to urine samples and incubation for 5 h at 40 degrees C led to twofold higher PI concentrations, although 18+/-7% of the amount of unconjugated PI was decomposed during incubation. We conclude that in humans PI is partially excreted as PI-O-glucuronide and that enzymatic hydrolysis extends the time of detectability for PI in urine samples.","The authors are grateful to Dr. Truls Baer and Sabina Sperisen for their support during the clinical study and wish to thank Dr. Thomas Lehmann and Dr. Hansjörg Helmlin for their help in solving several analytical problems and Dr. Theodor Huber for the physical examinations of the volunteers.

Psilocybin and psilocin are the active compounds, responsible for the hallucinogenic effects and are a part of the substance group, derived from tryptamine and characterized by an indole nucleus. We report a clinical case observed in an emergency unit and review the historical, epidemiological and pharmacological data now available for these intoxications.

The commonest of these are the ""liberty cap"" or ""magic mushrooms"" (Psilocybe semilanceata). On the basis of experience from USA and western Europa, increase in employment of this mushrooms as a hallucinogenic intoxicant may be anticipated in Denmark. The history, epidemiology, botany and pharmacology of the mushroom are reviewed. Clinical pictures and treatment are described for: 1) Acute poisoning with psilocybin-containing fungi, 2) Late sequelae of consumption of psilocybin-containing fungi and 3) Poisoning with more poisonous fungi on account of incorrect identification. General practitioners, duty roster doctors, doctors in casualty departments and in acute psychiatric departments should be aware of these problems. Intoxication with psilocybin may be confused with panic anxiety or euphoria in persons with mydriasis and other sympathomimetic symptoms.

This study examines the role played by self-experimentation in the production of health data collected in these projects. We ask: How does the collaborative context of online health communities, with their ability to facilitate far-reaching collaborations over time and space, transform the practice and epistemological foundations of engaging in n = 1 experimentation? We draw from a digital ethnography of an online patient-led research movement, in which participants engage in self-experiments to develop a protocol for using psilocybe-containing mushrooms as a treatment for cluster headache, an excruciating neurological disease for which there is little medical research and huge unmet treatment need. We find that the collectivizing features of the internet have collectivized self-experimentation. Group dynamics shape everything in ""collective self-experimentation,"" from individual choices of intervention, reporting of outcomes, data analysis, determinations of efficacy, to embodiment. This study raises important questions about the role that individuals play in the creation of medical knowledge and the data that informs crowdsourced research.","We are grateful for helpful comments from Rene Almeling, Laura Carpenter, Jennifer Reich, Kyla Schuller, anonymous reviewers, funding from the Gretel Weiss Faculty-Student Collaboration Awards, and support from the Institute for Research on Women at Rutgers University.",,Social Science & Medicine,,Elsevier,"0277-9536, 1873-5347",Autoexperimentation; Community Networks; Diffusion of Innovation; Humans; Internet; Social Media,12/06/2019,2019,12/06/2019,2019-10,238,,112366,Closed,Article,"Kempner, Joanna; Bailey, John","Kempner, Joanna (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.

The use of psychedelic plant preparations among New World tribes is far more prevalent than in the Old World. Yet, although these preparations are botanically diverse, almost all are chemically similar in that their active principles are tryptamine derivatives, either DMT or related constituents. Part 1 of this paper provides an ethnopharmacological overview of the major tryptamine-containing New World hallucinogens. Part 2 focuses on ayahuasca and its effects on the human brain. Using complementary neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques, we have identified brain areas involved in the cognitive effects induced by this complex botanical preparation. Initial SPECT data showed that ayahuasca modulated activity in higher order association areas of the brain. Increased blood perfusion was observed mainly in anterior brain regions encompassing the frontomedial and anterior cingulate cortices of the frontal lobes, and in the medial regions of the temporal lobes. On the other hand, applying spectral analysis and source location techniques to cortical electrical signals, we found changes in neuronal activity that predominated in more posterior sensory-selective areas of the brain. Now, using functional connectivity analysis of brain oscillations we have been able to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. By measuring transfer entropy, a metric based on information theory, we have shown that ayahuasca temporarily modifies the ordinary flow of information within the brain. We propose a model in which ayahuasca reduces top-down constraints and facilitates bottom-up information transfer. By simultaneously enhancing endogenous cortical excitability and reducing higher-order cognitive control, ayahuasca temporarily disrupts neural hierarchies allowing inner exploration and a new outlook on reality.",,,Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences,Behavioral Neurobiology of Psychedelic Drugs,Springer Nature,"1866-3370, 1866-3389",Animals; Banisteriopsis; Brain; Ethnopharmacology; Hallucinogens; Humans; Tryptamines,2016,2016,02/04/2017,2016,36,,283-311,Closed,Chapter,"McKenna, Dennis; Riba, Jordi","McKenna, Dennis (Director of Ethnopharmacology, Heffter Research Institute, Santa Fe, NM, USA); Riba, Jordi (Human Neuropsychopharmacology Research Group, Sant Pau Institute of Biomedical Research (IIB-Sant Pau), C/Sant Antoni María Claret, 167, 08025, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona, Spain)","Riba, Jordi (Hospital de Sant Pau; Autonomous University of Barcelona)","McKenna, Dennis (Heffter Research Institute); Riba, Jordi (Hospital de Sant Pau; Autonomous University of Barcelona)",Heffter Research Institute; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Hospital de Sant Pau,grid.488828.6; grid.7080.f; grid.413396.a,Santa Fe; Cerdanyola del Vallès; Barcelona,New Mexico; ; ,United States; Spain; Spain,,,,,,34,17,1.48,5.39,31,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084781201,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences,Mental health,1.1 Normal biological development and functioning,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",

Anecdotal reports of torsades de pointes (TdP), arrhythmias and/or sudden death and small studies in normal subjects have suggested that simple ingredients such as grapefruit juice or ingredients in energy drinks marketed as dietary supplements could have direct arrhythmogenic actions, especially in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS). Two recent studies that employed the industry-standard ""thorough QT"" trial design leave no doubt that grapefruit juice and some energy drinks can prolong the QTc interval and to exceed 500 msec. in some patients with cLQTS, a threshold known to signal imminent danger. These reports raise numerous clinically important questions such as which other patients may be at risk of arrhythmias.

A Web-Based Description of E-Psychonauts,"Within online drug fora communities, there are some ""educated and informed"" users who can somehow provide reliable information on psychoactive compounds and combinations. These users, also called ""e-psychonauts,"" may possess levels of technical knowledge relating to a range of novel psychoactive substances (NPS). The present project aimed at identifying and describing the e-psychonauts' socio-demographic characteristics and their motivations and patterns of drug intake. A netnographic research methodology, carried out through an unobtrusive observational approach of a list of cyber drug communities (blogs, fora, Facebook, and Twitter pages) was carried out. The fora posts and threads were accurately reviewed, analyzed, and compared using the empirical phenomenological psychological (EPP) method. Data were collected between January and February 2014. Psychonauts typically considered themselves as ""psychedelic researchers,"" ""new Shamans,"" ""philosophers,"" or ""alchemists."" They appeared to be mainly young, males, unmarried, and Caucasians. They presented with good or excellent employment conditions and with a set of key skills, including attention to their inner ""soul""; high standards of knowledge about drugs' chemical and pharmacological issues; and high levels of both IT skills and verbal fluency in reporting their own ""on drug"" experiences. The e-psychonauts seemed to ""test"" and at times synthesize a range of drugs to achieve the state of consciousness they find most pleasurable.

In addition to LSD and psilocybin hallucinogens of biologic origin are increasingly used by adolescents and young adults.
METHODS: Relevant literature and related articles were identified by means of a computerized MEDLINE search including the years 1997 - 2007. As keywords ""hallucinogen induced psychosis"", ""hallucinogen induced flashback"", ""hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD)"" were used. Finally, 64 journal articles and books out of 103 were included in the review.
RESULTS: Acute psychotic syndromes in adolescents are rarely due to intoxications with hallucinogenic drugs. However, clinical relevance of flashback phenomena as post-hallucinogenic psychiatric disorder has to be disputed. Because of the high popularity of biogenic hallucinogens and LSD knowledge of intoxications and resulting psychiatric disorders as well as medical complications and therapeutical approaches are clinically important.

Such increases have also been noted among university students and there is a need for a large survey across different universities and faculties. We report such a survey.
METHODS: Information about drinking, use of cannabis and other illicit drugs, other lifestyle variables, and subjective ratings of anxiety and depression was obtained by questionnaire in a cross-faculty sample of 3075 second-year university students (1610 men, 1447 women, 18 sex not stated) from ten UK universities. The questionnaire was personally administered during scheduled lecture hours and almost all the students participated. The sample reflected the interfaculty and sex distribution and the proportion of non-white students at UK universities.
FINDINGS: 11% of the students were non-drinkers. Among drinkers, 61% of the men and 48% of the women exceeded ""sensible"" limits of 14 units per week for women and 21 for men. Hazardous drinking (> or = 36 units per week for women, > or = 51 for men) was reported by 15% of the drinkers. Binge drinking was declared by 28% of drinkers. 60% of the men and 55% of the women reported having used cannabis once or twice and 20% of the sample reported regular cannabis use (weekly or more often). Experience with other illicit drugs was reported by 33% of the sample, most commonly LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), amphetamines, Ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), and amyl/butyl nitrate which had each been used by 13-18% of students. 34% of these had used several drugs. Drug use had started at school in 46% of the sample; 13% began after entering university. The overwhelming reason given for taking alcohol or drugs was pleasure. Subjective ratings of anxiety on the hospital anxiety depression scale were high, and sleep difficulties were common, but neither related to alcohol or drug use.
INTERPRETATION: There is a need for better education about alcohol, drugs, and general health in universities. Such education should include all faculties. It remains unclear whether university students' lifestyles are carried over into later life.",,,The Lancet,,Elsevier,"0140-6736, 1474-547X",Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Anxiety; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Students; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Universities,1996-10,1996,,1996-10,348,9032,922-925,Closed,Article,"Webb, E; Ashton, CH; Kelly, P; Kamali, F","Webb, E (Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK); Ashton, CH (Department of Psychiatry, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK); Kelly, P (Department of Medical Statistics, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK); Kamali, F (Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK)","Kamali, F (Newcastle University)","Webb, E (Newcastle University); Ashton, CH (Newcastle University); Kelly, P (Newcastle University); Kamali, F (Newcastle University)",Newcastle University,grid.1006.7,Newcastle upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,331,17,8.99,,8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007373200,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Depression; Mental Health; Pediatric; Substance Misuse; Underage Drinking",Mental health,,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",3 Good Health and Well Being

Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist who discovered LSD and psilocybin, believed that these psychedelic drugs might be useful in treating mental illness; the company he worked for, Sandoz, sent them to doctors around the world for experimentation in the 1950s and '60s.

Although the serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and N,N-dimethyltryptamine have been termed the classical hallucinogens, many hallucinogens elicit their actions through other mechanisms such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism, opioid receptor agonism, or inhibition of the reuptake of monoamines including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

OBJECTIVES: The archaeological, ethno-historical and ethnographic evidence of the use of hallucinogenic substances in Mesoamerica is reviewed.
RESULTS: Hallucinogenic cactus, plants and mushrooms were used to induce altered states of consciousness in healing rituals and religious ceremonies. The Maya drank balché (a mixture of honey and extracts of Lonchocarpus) in group ceremonies to achieve intoxication. Ritual enemas and other psychoactive substances were also used to induce states of trance. Olmec, Zapotec, Maya and Aztec used peyote, hallucinogenic mushrooms (teonanacatl: Psilocybe spp) and the seeds of ololiuhqui (Turbina corymbosa), that contain mescaline, psilocybin and lysergic acid amide, respectively. The skin of the toad Bufo spp contains bufotoxins with hallucinogenic properties, and was used since the Olmec period. Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), wild tobacco (Nicotiana rustica), water lily (Nymphaea ampla) and Salvia divinorum were used for their psychoactive effects. Mushroom stones dating from 3000 BC have been found in ritual contexts in Mesoamerica. Archaeological evidence of peyote use dates back to over 5000 years. Several chroniclers, mainly Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, described their effects in the sixteenth century.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of psychoactive substances was common in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies. Today, local shamans and healers still use them in ritual ceremonies in Mesoamerica.",,,Neurología,,Elsevier,"0213-4853, 1578-1968","Art; Ceremonial Behavior; Fungi; Hallucinogens; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Mexico; Plants, Medicinal; Religion; Religion and Medicine",03/09/2011,2011,03/09/2011,2015-01,30,1,42-49,Closed,Article,"Carod-Artal, F.J.","Carod-Artal, F.J.

Mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin have been correlated with therapeutic benefits and long-term improvements in positive mental outlook and attitudes. This article aims to provide an overview of the topic, highlight strengths and weaknesses in current research, generate novel perspectives and discussion, and consider future avenues for research.
DESIGN: This narrative review was designed to summarise and assess the state of research on psilocybin occasioned mystical-type experiences and applications for the treatment of specific psychiatric conditions.
RESULTS: Contemporary methods on the quantification of mystical-type experiences and their acute subjective effects are discussed. Recent studies provide some understanding of the pharmacological actions of psychedelics although the neurological similarities and differences between spontaneous and psychedelic mystical-type experiences are not well described. Applicability to modern clinical settings is assessed. Potential novel therapeutic applications include use in positive psychology interventions in healthy individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Since 2006 significant advancements in understanding the therapeutic potential of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy have been made; however, more work is required to understand the neuromechanistic processes and applicability in modern clinical settings. Despite promising results in recent studies, funding issues for clinical trials, legal concerns and socio-cultural resistance provide a counterpoint to experimental evidence.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not‐for‐profit sectors.

This review summarizes the key renal manifestations of recreational drugs as reported in case reports and case. A comprehensive review of published case reports and case series in English language of renal toxicity related to recreational drugs/drugs of abuse was conducted using search engines like PubMed/Medline. Publications which reported renal injury with raised creatinine levels, clinically symptomatic patients, those with oliguria and with renal biopsies are chosen. The medical literature on recreational drugs is full of claims of renal complications including different glomerular diseases, acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, interstitial nephritis, and debilitating irreversible conditions like renal infarction and end stage renal disease, even though the pathogenesis of drug- related renal manifestations are not available for all the newer agents.

It is estimated that 12% of the world population suffers from migraine. Although a number of drugs have been used for treatment of migraine, most of these are not effective for every patient and may have undesirable side-effects. Thus, there is an enormous unmet need in current migraine therapy for discovering safer and more effective agents.
METHODS: The information summarized in this review was obtained through extensive literature review and search of relevant books and articles with the use of Web of Knowledge and SciVerse Scopus databases.
RESULTS: Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiopathogenesis of migraine is helpful in identifying novel targets for antimigraine drugs such as cannabinoid, histamine, and melatonin receptors. In the past, natural product-derived constituents have served as an invaluable source of numerous medicinally useful antimigraine agents and it may be expected that further promising drug candidates from natural products will be discovered for antimigraine pharmacotherapy with better efficacy and fewer adverse-effects.
CONCLUSION: The discovery of novel targets in migraine therapy has opened new horizons for compounds that have not been clinically tested or that previously failed in clinical trials as potential antimigraine drugs. Ginkgolide B, melatonin, histamine, oxytocin, various ribosomal peptide toxins, kavalactones, devil's claw-derived compounds, salvinorin A and petasin are among those agents that show considerable promise as novel drugs in migraine prevention and treatment. It is necessary to conduct more research to better understand their antimigraine action, to confirm their effectiveness and safety, and to introduce them into clinical practice.","I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Adela Frankova for helpful discuss-ions, valuable comments during the manuscript preparation and for providing critical review of the final version.

Some of these substances are associated with ancestral religious ceremonies, while many of them are legal or are partially regulated. Salvia divinorum is a powerful kappa receptor agonist, with dissociative and hallucinogenic properties, which start quickly and have a short duration. Kratom (Mytragyna speciosa) has mitragynine as its principal alkaloid, with stimulating effects at low doses (coke-like effect), and sedative effects (opiate-like effect) at high doses. Several deaths from its consumption have been detected. The consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms appears in cyclic form, although there has been increase in their online offer. They are consumed in search of their hallucinogenic effects, above all those belonging to the family of psilocybes, which contain tryptamines with a hallucinogenic effect similar to LSD. Peyote (Lophophora psilocybes), a cactus rich in mescaline (trimetoxifeniletilamina), produces hallucinations of the five senses, and forms part of the religious culture of the North American Indians. Daturas, which are ubiquitous, produce anticholinergic symptoms and effects on the central nervous system (delirium, hallucinations, etc.), due to their high atropine and scopolamine content. Other substances used for their hallucinogenic effects include the drink known as ayahuasca, and seeds for preparing infusions like Ololiuqui, Morning Glory (Ipomoea violacea), Hawaian Baby Woodrose (Argyreia nervosa), Syrian Rue (Peganum harmala) and Iboga Rootbark (Tabernanthe iboga).",,,Anales del Sistema Sanitario de Navarra,,SciELO Espana/Repisalud,"1137-6627, 2340-3527",Agaricales; Hallucinogens; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Plants; Substance-Related Disorders,2013-12,2013,2013-12,2013,36,3,505-518,All OA; Gold,Article,"Burillo-Putze, G.; Briz, E.

Extracts from 45% of the isolates, representing 109 species, showed antimicrobial activity. Antibacterial activity was more pronounced than antifungal activity. The proportion of extracts from basidiomycetes showing antimicrobial activity was similar to or above that obtained for representative orders of Ascomycetes, such as Pezizales and Xylariales, but lower than that produced by members of the orders Diaporthales, Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Leotiales and Sordariales.

An extract of a truffle-like fungus containing psilocin, psilocybin and baeocystin was chosen as test material. Three different modeling methods were applied to describe the retention times of constituents in isocratic separation mode as a function of mobile phase composition, pH and temperature. Two models using DryLab® 2010 assumed quadratic and exponential relationship between the retention time and solvent fraction of aqueous component of the mobile phase, respectively. These models also illustrate the van't Hoff like equation to describe the temperature-dependence of the retention factor and the theory of Snyder et al. to estimate the retention factor as a function of pH of the aqueous mobile phase component. The third model using STATISTICA® multivariate data analysis in a predefined experimental space was able to predict the retention times. All HILIC columns in this comparison were proved to be suitable for separation of the two hallucinogenic alkaloids from each other and from the matrix components. Majority of compounds were separated with satisfactory resolutions required by the comparative analysis despite some of them were not fully baseline separated. It was found the best modeling was obtained by using the quadratic approach to predict chromatograms for predefined chromatographic conditions (volumetric ratio of acetonitrile to buffer, pH of the buffer and temperature), while the exponential model proved to be the worst for prediction. The modeling with multivariate data analysis fell between the other two methods.",Authors thank László Hunyadvári for constructing some of the figures in this work.,,Journal of Chromatographic Science,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0021-9665, 1945-239X","Agaricales; Alkaloids; Chromatography, Liquid; Hallucinogens; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Models, Chemical",07/12/2018,2018,07/12/2018,01/03/2019,57,3,230-237,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Rácz, Norbert; Nagy, Júlia; Jiang, Wen; Veress, Tibor","Rácz, Norbert (Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Faculty of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, Department of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, H-1111 Budapest, Műegyetem rkp. 3, Hungary); Nagy, Júlia (Department of Drug and Arson Investigation, Hungarian Institute for Forensic Sciences, Mosonyi Street 9, Budapest, Hungary); Jiang, Wen (HILICON AB, Tvistevägen 48, Umeå, Sweden); Veress, Tibor (Department of Drug and Arson Investigation, Hungarian Institute for Forensic Sciences, Mosonyi Street 9, Budapest, Hungary)",,"Rácz, Norbert (Budapest University of Technology and Economics); Nagy, Júlia (Bűnügyi Szakértői és Kutatóintézet); Jiang, Wen (); Veress, Tibor (Bűnügyi Szakértői és Kutatóintézet)",Bűnügyi Szakértői és Kutatóintézet; Budapest University of Technology and Economics,grid.418695.7; grid.6759.d,Budapest; Budapest,; Pest,Hungary; Hungary,,,,,,11,6,1.18,1.36,2,https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article-pdf/57/3/230/27696615/bmy104.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1109975629,34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

The studied hallucinogenic compounds were effectively extracted with a mixture of methanol and 1 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 3 (1:1 v/v) using ultrasound-assisted procedure. The obtained extracts were separated and determined by CZE utilizing a 25 mM sodium phosphate running buffer adjusted to pH 3 with 5% content of acetonitrile v/v. The calibration curves for both analytes were linear in the range of 2.5-7000 μg/mL. The intraday and interday variations of quantitative data were 1.0 and 2.5% RSD, respectively.

Recently they were recognized as Squamanitaceae, but previous studies used few DNA markers from a restricted sample of taxa from the family and lacked a formal taxonomic treatment. In this study, with newly generated sequences of the type of the genus Squamanita, S. schreieri, and several additional species of the family, the phylogeny is reinvestigated with a concatenated (18S-5.8S-nrLSU-RPB2-TEF1-α) dataset. This study reveals that Cystoderma, Phaeolepiota, Squamanita, Floccularia, and Leucopholiota are a monophyletic clade with strong statistical support in Bayesian analysis and form Squamanitaceae. Phaeolepiota nested within Cystoderma; Squamanita, Leucopholiota, and Floccularia clustered together as two monophyletic subclades; and Squamanita was present as a monophyletic clade with strong statistical support in both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses. The family name Squamanitaceae is formally emended and a detailed taxonomic treatment is presented to accommodate the five genera. Meanwhile, another concatenated (18S-ITS-nrLSU-RPB2-TEF1-α) dataset is used to investigate phylogenetic relationships and species delimitation in Squamanita. Our data indicates that “S. umbonata” from the Northern hemisphere forms two species complexes, one complex includes six specimens from North America, Europe, and East Asia, the other includes two specimens from Central America and North America respectively. Futhermore, species of Squamanita can parasitize species of Amanita, besides other fungal species. Squamanita mira parasitizes A. kitamagotake (A. sect. Caesareae), while S. orientalis and S. sororcula are parasites of species belonging to the A. sepiacea complex (A. sect. Validae). “Squamanita umbonata” from Italy occurs on A. excelsa (A. sect. Validae). Three new species of Squamanita from East Asia, viz. S. mira, S. orientalis and S. sororcula are documented with morphological, multi-gene phylogenetic, and ecological data, along with line drawings and photographs, and compared with similar species. A key for identification of the global Squamanita species is provided.","We are very grateful to the fungaria of New York Botanical Garden, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, and also Reinhard Berndt, Fabrizio Boccardo, Li-Hong Han, Fa Li, and Gang Wu for providing specimens and images for this study; Shannon Asencio for providing helpful locality information on DAOM 199323 and DAOM 225481; and Bang Feng, Xiao-Bin Liu, Yan-Liang Wang, and Gang Wu for revising early manuscript.",,IMA Fungus,,Springer Nature,"2210-6340, 2210-6359",,03/03/2021,2021,03/03/2021,2021-12,12,1,4,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liu, Jian-Wei; Ge, Zai-Wei; Horak, Egon; Vizzini, Alfredo; Halling, Roy E.; Pan, Chun-Lei; Yang, Zhu L.","Liu, Jian-Wei (Yunnan Key Laboratory for Fungal Diversity and Green Development, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 650201, Kunming, Yunnan, China; The Germplasm Bank of Wild Species, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 132 Lanhei Road, Kunming, 650201 Yunnan, People’s Republic of China); Ge, Zai-Wei (Yunnan Key Laboratory for Fungal Diversity and Green Development, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 650201, Kunming, Yunnan, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Plant Diversity and Biogeography of East Asia, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 650201, Kunming, Yunnan, China); Horak, Egon (Schlossfeld 17, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria); Vizzini, Alfredo (Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, University of Torino and Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection (IPSP-SS Turin), C.N.R, Viale P.A.

The delimitation of species and infrageneric units hitherto has been based on morphological and, to some extent, ecological characters. In this study we have analyzed nuclear ribosomal LSU and ITS sequences to reveal infrageneric phylogeny and the phylogenetic placement of Galerina among the dark-spored agarics. Sequences from 36 northern hemisphere Galerina species and 19 other dark-spored taxa were analyzed, some of them obtained from EMBL/GenBank. Our results, received from Bayesian and distance methods, strongly suggest that Galerina is a polyphyletic genus. The LSU analysis shows that Galerina is composed of three or four separate monophyletic main groups. In addition, a few species cluster together with other dark-spored agarics. The same groups are recognized in the ITS tree and they correspond roughly to previously recognized subgenera or sections in Galerina. With high support our LSU analysis suggests that Gymnopilus is a monophyletic genus and that Gymnopilus and one of the Galerina lineages (""mycenopsis"") are sister groups. The analyses further indicate that the Galerina lineages, as well as the genus Gymnopilus, could be referred to a strongly emendated family Strophariaceae, which corresponds largely to the family as circumscribed by Kühner (1980). Our results affirm that morphological characters often are highly homoplastic in the agarics. At the present stage formal taxonomic consequences or nomenclatural changes are not proposed.","We thank the curators of the herbaria at the Botanical Museum, Copenhagen, the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, and the Rijksherbarium in Leiden for kindly providing material, and Ronald Petersen, Knoxville, for providing data from mating experiments.

Reference is also made to the way in which the different types of existing substances originated, with the aim of achieving a better understanding of their use and in order to administer the most suitable treatment when poisoning occurs. Cocaine poisoning is discussed, with reference to its clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment. The consumption of illegal drugs in our country has undergone a notable change in recent years, with heroin being relegated and the incorporation of cocaine, amphetamine derivatives such as ""ecstasy"" (MDMA), ""liquid ecstasy"" (GHB) and, to a lesser extent, ketamine. A review is made of cannabis and its derivates, from the history of its consumption and the preparations employed to the effects produced in the different bodily systems.

The fungi studied were Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium lateritium, Phoma exigua and Trichoderma viride, all of which are common inhabitants of UK upland grassland soils. Resource quality was varied by using three contrasting grasses as sources of lamina fragments: Lolium perenne, Agrostis capillaris and Nardus stricta. All the fungi were able to forage effectively through the soil-like matrix (at a rate of 1-2 ml matrix d-1 ) and colonize and partially decompose available lamina fragments (up to 40% d. wt loss). Foraging rates (ml matrix d-1 ) were affected by lamina fragment species but not by fragment density or size. In general, F. lateritium and T. viride foraged at a faster rate than the other species. Mycelial activity in the soil-like matrix was directly proportional to total lamina fragment availability and was unaffected by fragment size. Biomass production on solid media was also directly related to substrate (carbohydrate) availability. The results indicate that these fungi can adjust their growth patterns in response to fragment density so as to maximize foraging efficiency (energy acquired per unit exploratory biomass production). Differences in lamina fragment species were responsible for up to 50% reduction in mycelial activity.",,,New Phytologist,,Wiley,"0028-646X, 1469-8137",,2000-10,2000,07/07/2008,2000-10,148,1,143-151,All OA; Bronze,Article,"GRIFFITH, G.

These drugs are capable of producing profound changes in sensory perception, mood and thought in humans and act primarily as agonists of the 5-HT2A receptor. Well-known tryptamines such as psilocybin contained in Aztec sacred mushrooms and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), present in South American psychoactive beverage ayahuasca, have been restrictedly used since ancient times in sociocultural and ritual contexts. However, with the discovery of hallucinogenic properties of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in mid-1900s, tryptamines began to be used recreationally among young people. More recently, new synthetically produced tryptamine hallucinogens, such as alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT), emerged in the recreational drug market, which have been claimed as the next-generation designer drugs to replace LSD (‘legal’ alternatives to LSD). Tryptamine derivatives are widely accessible over the Internet through companies selling them as ‘research chemicals’, but can also be sold in ‘headshops’ and street dealers. Reports of intoxication and deaths related to the use of new tryptamines have been described over the last years, raising international concern over tryptamines. However, the lack of literature pertaining to pharmacological and toxicological properties of new tryptamine hallucinogens hampers the assessment of their actual potential harm to general public health. This review provides a comprehensive update on tryptamine hallucinogens, concerning their historical background, prevalence, patterns of use and legal status, chemistry, toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics and their physiological and toxicological effects on animals and humans.","This work received financial support from the European Union (FEDER funds through COMPETE) and National Funds (FCT, Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia) through project Pest-C/EQB/LA0006/2013.",,Archives of Toxicology,,Springer Nature,"0340-5761, 1432-0738","Animals; Brain; Hallucinogens; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Molecular Structure; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tryptamines",16/04/2015,2015,16/04/2015,2015-08,89,8,1151-1173,Closed,Article,"Araújo, Ana Margarida; Carvalho, Félix; Bastos, Maria de Lourdes; Guedes de Pinho, Paula; Carvalho, Márcia","Araújo, Ana Margarida (UCIBIO-REQUIMTE, Laboratório de Toxicologia, Departamento de Ciências Biológicas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, 228, 4050-313, Porto, Portugal); Carvalho, Félix (UCIBIO-REQUIMTE, Laboratório de Toxicologia, Departamento de Ciências Biológicas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, 228, 4050-313, Porto, Portugal); Bastos, Maria de Lourdes (UCIBIO-REQUIMTE, Laboratório de Toxicologia, Departamento de Ciências Biológicas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, 228, 4050-313, Porto, Portugal); Guedes de Pinho, Paula (UCIBIO-REQUIMTE, Laboratório de Toxicologia, Departamento de Ciências Biológicas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, 228, 4050-313, Porto, Portugal); Carvalho, Márcia (UCIBIO-REQUIMTE, Laboratório de Toxicologia, Departamento de Ciências Biológicas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, 228, 4050-313, Porto, Portugal; FP-ENAS, CEBIMED, Fundação Ensino e Cultura Fernando Pessoa, Porto, Portugal)","Araújo, Ana Margarida (University of Porto); Carvalho, Márcia (University of Porto; )","Araújo, Ana Margarida (University of Porto); Carvalho, Félix (University of Porto); Bastos, Maria de Lourdes (University of Porto); Guedes de Pinho, Paula (University of Porto); Carvalho, Márcia (University of Porto)",University of Porto,grid.5808.5,Porto,,Portugal,European Commission; Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia,cOAlition S; EC & ERC - European Union,Belgium; Portugal,grant.9954124,EST-C/EQB/LA0006/2013,137,50,5.86,21.12,25,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022572784,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,Generic health relevance,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being

Poisoning with pharmaceuticals is predominantly observed in adults. A detailed medical history and an accurate clinical examination establish the basis for the diagnostics. Typical poisoning syndromes can be classified based on the clinical presentation. Drug screening in urine and examination of blood alcohol levels are useful additional tools because of the rapid and widespread availability. Securing vital organ functions is the mainstay of treatment and early contact with a poisons centre is useful for the assessment of the hazard and the further procedures.

In this paper generic names of the Agaricomycotina (Basidiomycota) were evaluated to determine synonymy based on their type. Forty-seven sets of sexually and asexually typified names were determined to be congeneric and recommendations are made for which generic name to use. In most cases the principle of priority is followed. However, 16 generic names are recommended for use that do not have priority and thus need to be protected: Aleurocystis over Matula; Armillaria over Acurtis and Rhizomorpha; Asterophora over Ugola; Botryobasidium over Acladium, Allescheriella, Alysidium, Haplotrichum, Physospora, and Sporocephalium; Coprinellus over Ozonium; Coprinopsis over Rhacophyllus; Dendrocollybia over Sclerostilbum and Tilachlidiopsis; Diacanthodes over Bornetina; Echinoporia over Echinodia; Neolentinus over Digitellus; Postia over Ptychogaster; Riopa over Sporotrichum; Scytinostroma over Artocreas, Michenera, and Stereofomes; Tulasnella over Hormomyces; Typhula over Sclerotium; and Wolfiporia over Gemmularia and Pachyma. Nine species names are proposed for protection: Botryobasidium aureum, B. conspersum, B. croceum, B. simile, Pellicularia lembosporum (syn. B. lembosporum), Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Polyporus metamorphosus (syn. Riopa metamorphosa), Polyporus mylittae (syn. Laccocephalum mylittae), and Polyporus ptychogaster (syn.

Cortical 5-HT2A receptors are key primary targets for the effects of serotonergic psychedelics. However, the therapeutic mechanisms underlying psychedelic therapy are complex and traverse molecular, cellular, and network levels, under the influence of biofeedback signals from the periphery and the environment. At the interface between the individual and the environment, the gut microbiome, via the gut-brain axis, plays an important role in the unconscious parallel processing systems regulating host neurophysiology. While psychedelic and microbial signalling systems operate over different timescales, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, as a convergence hub between multiple biofeedback systems may play a role in the preparatory phase, the acute administration phase, and the integration phase of psychedelic therapy. In keeping with an interconnected systems-based approach, this review will discuss the gut microbiome and mycobiome and pathways of the MGB axis, and then explore the potential interaction between psychedelic therapy and the MGB axis and how this might influence mechanism of action and treatment response. Finally, we will discuss the possible implications for a precision medicine-based psychedelic therapy paradigm.",We would like to acknowledge Paul Quinlan who designed Fig. 1 and Christopher Connolly for his review of the manuscript.,"JK was the sub-PI on the COMPASS trials (COMP 001, 003, 004) in Ireland.

Pharmacological challenge with the 5-HT2A agonist psilocybin (PY) is useful in studying the neurobiological basis of cognition and consciousness.ObjectiveInvestigation of dose-dependent effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical and physiological parameters.MethodsEight subjects received placebo (PL), and 45 (“very low dose, VLD”), 115 (“low dose, LD”), 215 (“medium dose, MD”), and 315 (“high dose, HD”) μg/kg body weight PY. The “Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale” (5D-ASC), the “Frankfurt Attention Inventory” (FAIR), and the “Adjective Mood Rating Scale” (AMRS) were used to assess the effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical core dimensions, attention, and mood. A 24-h electrocardiogram (EKG) was recorded and blood pressure was measured. Plasma concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), cortisol (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and standard clinical chemical parameters were determined.ResultsPY dose dependently increased scores of all 5D-ASC core dimensions. Only one subject reacted with transient anxiety to HD PY. Compared with PL, MD and HD PY led to a 50% reduction of performance in the FAIR test. “General inactivation”, “emotional excitability”, and “dreaminess” were the only domains of the AMRS showing increased scores following MD and HD PY. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was moderately elevated only 60 min following administration of HD PY. Neither EKG nor body temperature was affected by any dose of PY. TSH, ACTH, and CORT plasma levels were elevated during peak effects of HD PY, whereas PRL plasma levels were increased following MD and HD PY.ConclusionPY affects core dimensions of altered states of consciousness and physiological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. Our study provided no cause for concern that PY is hazardous with respect to somatic health.","The authors thank Drs Dieter Vonderschmitt, Arnold von Eckardstein, and Kathrin Rentsch, Institute of Clinical Chemistry of the University of Zürich, for analysis of hormones and clinical-chemical parameters, and Martin Dobricki for assistance during the experimental part of the study.

However, these are only partially effective. Hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, may represent potential new treatment options for SUD. This review provides a summary of (human) studies on the putative therapeutic effects of psilocybin, and discusses the receptor systems, brain regions and cognitive and emotional processes mediating psilocybin's effects. Psilocybin's chemical structure is similar to that of serotonin. Dysregulations in the serotonin system are associated with alterations in stress hormones, such as cortisol, and mood disorders. After psilocybin administration cortisol levels spike and activate the executive control network, with subsequent increased control over emotional processes, and relief of negative thinking and persistent negative emotions. Preliminary data of ongoing alcohol and smoking addiction studies in humans shows promising effects of psilocybin administration on substance use. Importantly, psilocybin has a low risk of toxicity and dependence and can be used safely under controlled clinical conditions. Areas covered: This paper is a narrative review based on the search terms: psilocybin, substance use disorder, addiction, depression, serotonin. Literature on potential efficacy and mechanisms of action of psilocybin in SUD is discussed. Expert commentary: Recent positive findings with psilocybin need confirmation in well-designed placebo controlled randomized trials employing a large sample size.",,This paper was not funded.,Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,,Taylor & Francis,"1473-7175, 1744-8360",Depression; Emotions; Hallucinogens; Humans; Psilocybin; Substance-Related Disorders,12/08/2016,2016,12/08/2016,2017-02,17,2,203-212,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"de Veen, Bas T.H.; Schellekens, Arnt F.A.; Verheij, Michel M.M.; Homberg, Judith R.","de Veen, Bas T.H.

An overview and suggestions for future research,"BACKGROUND: In the past few years, the issue of 'microdosing' psychedelics has been openly discussed in the public arena where claims have been made about their positive effect on mood state and cognitive processes such as concentration. However, there are very few scientific studies that have specifically addressed this issue, and there is no agreed scientific consensus on what microdosing is.
AIM: This critique paper is designed to address questions that need to be answered by future scientific studies and to offer guidelines for these studies.
APPROACH: Owing to its proximity for a possible approval in clinical use and short-lasting pharmacokinetics, our focus is predominantly on psilocybin. Psilocybin is allegedly, next to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), one of the two most frequently used psychedelics to microdose. Where relevant and available, data for other psychedelic drugs are also mentioned.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that while most anecdotal reports focus on the positive experiences with microdosing, future research should also focus on potential risks of (multiple) administrations of a psychedelic in low doses. To that end, (pre)clinical studies including biological (e.g. heart rate, receptor turnover and occupancy) as well as cognitive (e.g. memory, attention) parameters have to be conducted and will shed light on the potential negative consequences microdosing could have.","Livia Ng was a paid intern and Anaïs Soula an employee for COMPASS Pathways.

This battery contained the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Padua Inventory Revised and additional questions about substance use. Our study population included abstainers and drug users with a wide history of use. We demonstrated strong associations between use of many different drugs, suggesting that polydrug use is the norm in this type of population. We found weak, but statistically significant, correlations between use of alcohol (p < 0.05), amphetamine (p < 0.01) and ecstasy (p < 0.01) with self-reported score on the BAI. There were also positive associations between dissociative symptomatology and the use of amphetamine (p < 0.05) and cocaine (p < 0.05). Furthermore, weekly unit intake of alcohol positively correlated with score on the CES-D (p < 0.05). As polydrug use was the norm in this sample, we performed regression analysis to investigate the contribution of multiple drug use on self-report. This showed that weekly use of alcohol, and frequency of use of amyl nitrate and cigarettes were significant predictors of BAI score. However, the majority of subjects reported being unworried by these symptoms, which may represent a lack of self-awareness, or acceptance of them as the subacute effects of substance use. It remains to be determined at what point adverse effects of drug use begin to interfere with day-to-day life.",,,Journal of Psychopharmacology,,SAGE Publications,"0269-8811, 1461-7285","Adolescent; Adult; Alcoholism; Anxiety Disorders; Depression; Female; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Male; Mental Disorders; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Psychoses, Substance-Induced; Regression Analysis; Self-Assessment; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires",2004-03,2004,02/07/2016,2004-03,18,1,75-82,Closed,Article,"Sumnall, Harry R.; Wagstaff, Graham F.; Cole, Jon C.","Sumnall, Harry R.

This study sought to examine whether altering the perceived quality of controlled drugs would affect drug purchases if the monetary price remained fixed. A random sample of 80 polydrug users were recruited. All participants were administered an anonymous questionnaire consisting of the Drug Abuse Screening Test for Adolescents (DAST-A), the Severity of Dependence Scale for cannabis (SDS), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions about their drug use. Participants then completed a simulation of controlled drug purchases where the price of alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy remained the same but their perceived quality changed (i.e. unit price increased as the perceived quality decreased). The demand for alcohol was quality inelastic and alcohol quality had no effects on the purchase of any other controlled drug. Demand for cannabis was quality elastic and alcohol substituted for cannabis as its unit price increased. Demand for cocaine was quality elastic and alcohol, cannabis, and ecstasy substituted for cocaine as its unit price increased. Demand for ecstasy was quality elastic and alcohol and cocaine both substituted for ecstasy as its unit price increased. These results suggest that perceived quality influences the demand for controlled drugs and that monitoring the perceived quality of controlled drugs may provide a warning of potential public health problems in the near future.",,,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,,Elsevier,"0376-8716, 1879-0046","Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Amphetamine; Catchment Area, Health; Cocaine-Related Disorders; Commerce; Comorbidity; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Mass Screening; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; Prevalence; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom",16/01/2008,2008,16/01/2008,2008-04,94,01-Mar,183-190,Closed,Article,"Cole, Jon C.; Goudie, Andrew J.; Field, Matt; Loverseed, Anne-Claire; Charlton, Sarah; Sumnall, Harry R.","Cole, Jon C.

Persistent stress causes neuronal atrophy, including loss of synapses and reduced size of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These alterations are associated with neural dysfunction, including mood disturbances, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes. Synaptic plasticity is the fundamental function of neural networks in response to various stimuli and acts by reorganizing neuronal structure, function, and connections from the molecular to the behavioral level. In this review, we describe the alterations in synaptic plasticity as underlying pathological mechanisms for depression in animal models and humans. We further elaborate on the significance of phytochemicals as bioactive agents that can positively modulate stress-induced, aberrant synaptic activity. Bioactive agents, including flavonoids, terpenes, saponins, and lignans, have been reported to upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and release, suppress neuronal loss, and activate the relevant signaling pathways, including TrkB, ERK, Akt, and mTOR pathways, resulting in increased spine maturation and synaptic numbers in the neuronal cells and in the brains of stressed animals. In clinical trials, phytochemical usage is regarded as safe and well-tolerated for suppressing stress-related parameters in patients with depression. Thus, intake of phytochemicals with safe and active effects on synaptic plasticity may be a strategy for preventing neuronal damage and alleviating depression in a stressful life.",,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2018M3A9C4076473) and the Gachon University Research Fund of 2019 (GCU-2019-0325).,Biomolecules & Therapeutics,,The Korean Society of Applied Pharmacology,"1976-9148, 2005-4483",,25/01/2023,2023,25/01/2023,01/03/2023,31,2,148-160,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Yoon, Soojung; Iqbal, Hamid; Kim, Sun Mi; Jin, Mirim","Yoon, Soojung (Department of Health Sciences and Technology, GAIHST, Gachon University, Incheon 21999, Republic of Korea); Iqbal, Hamid (Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon 21999, Republic of Korea; Lee Gil Ya Cancer and Diabetes Institute, Gachon University, Incheon 21999, Republic of Korea); Kim, Sun Mi (Department of Psychiatry, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea; Department of Psychiatry, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul 06973, Republic of Korea); Jin, Mirim (Department of Health Sciences and Technology, GAIHST, Gachon University, Incheon 21999, Republic of Korea; Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon 21999, Republic of Korea; Lee Gil Ya Cancer and Diabetes Institute, Gachon University, Incheon 21999, Republic of Korea)","Jin, Mirim (Gachon University; Gachon University; Gachon University)","Yoon, Soojung (Gachon University); Iqbal, Hamid (Gachon University; Gachon University); Kim, Sun Mi (Chung-Ang University; Chung-Ang University Hospital); Jin, Mirim (Gachon University; Gachon University; Gachon University)",Chung-Ang University; Chung-Ang University Hospital; Gachon University,grid.254224.7; grid.411651.6; grid.256155.0,Seoul; Seoul; Seongnam-si,; ; ,South Korea; South Korea; South Korea,National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science and ICT,,South Korea; South Korea,,,1,1,,,,https://www.biomolther.org/journal/download_pdf.php?doi=10.4062/biomolther.2022.116,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154831315,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Complementary and Integrative Health; Depression; Mental Health; Neurosciences,Mental health; Neurological,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",

The hallucinogenic drugs can be categorised into 4 basic groups: indole alkaloid derivatives, piperidine derivatives, phenylethylamines and the cannabinols. The drugs reviewed include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, marijuana, psilocybin, mescaline, and ‘designer drugs.’Particularly noteworthy is that each hallucinogen produces characteristic behavioural effects which are related to its serotonergic, dopaminergic or adrenergic activity. Cocaine produces simple hallucinations, PCP can produce complex hallucinations analogous to a paranoid psychosis, while LSD produces a combination of hallucinations, pseudohallucinations and illusions. Dose relationships with changes in the quality of the hallucinatory experience have been described with amphetamines and, to some extent, LSD. Flashbacks have been described with LSD and alcohol.Management of the intoxicated patient is dependent on the specific behavioural manifestation elicited by the drug. The principles involve differentiating the patient’s symptoms from organic (medical or toxicological) and psychiatric aetiologies and identifying the symptom complex associated with the particular drug. Panic reactions may require treatment with a benzodiazepine or haloperidol. Patients with LSD psychosis may require an antipsychotic. Patients exhibiting prolonged drug-induced psychosis may require a variety of treatments including ECT, lithium and l-5-hydroxytryptophan.",,,Drug Safety,,Springer Nature,"0114-5916, 1179-1942, 0113-5244",Hallucinogens; Humans,1989-10,1989,27/11/2012,1989-10,4,5,324-350,Closed,Article,"Leikin, Jerrold B.; Krantz, Anne J.; Zell-Kanter, Michele; Barkin, Robert L.; Hryhorczuk, Daniel O.","Leikin, Jerrold B.

However, these models rarely take account of the perceived quality (i.e. potency) of controlled drugs. Therefore we investigated the effects of both price and quality on the decision to purchase controlled drugs by polysubstance misusers. Forty current polysubstance misusers (29 males, 11 females; mean age 23.8) were recruited into the study. Participants were asked to hypothetically purchase drugs from a price list of alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy at different levels of quality and price (i.e. better quality drugs cost more money). The disposable income available for those purchases was systematically varied in order to determine the impact of income on the decision to purchase drugs. Demand for both normal and strong alcohol was income inelastic. Demand for both poor and average quality cannabis and ecstasy was income inelastic, but demand for good quality cannabis and ecstasy was income elastic. The demand for poor quality cocaine was income inelastic, with the demand for both average and good quality cocaine being income elastic. Participants reported too few purchases of amphetamine, which precluded behavioural economic analysis. These results suggest that, like other goods, controlled drugs are purchased based upon the consumer's interpretations of their relative value. Therefore, it is probable that the purchase and subsequent use of controlled drugs by polysubstance misusers will be heavily influenced by the economic environment.",This work received no external funding.,,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,,Elsevier,"0376-8716, 1879-0046","Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Beverages; Amphetamine; Cannabinoids; Commerce; Consumer Behavior; Consumer Product Safety; Decision Making; England; Female; Humans; Income; Male; Motivation; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; Statistics as Topic; Substance-Related Disorders",24/01/2007,2007,24/01/2007,10/07/2007,89,02-Mar,107-115,Closed,Article,"Goudie, Andrew J.; Sumnall, Harry R.; Field, Matt; Clayton, Hannah; Cole, Jon C.","Goudie, Andrew J.

However, much remains unknown about the diversity of edible mushrooms, including the number of wild edible mushroom species and their distributions. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3585 mushroom samples from wild mushroom markets in 35 counties across Yunnan Province from 2010 to 2019. Among these samples, we successfully obtained the DNA barcode sequences from 2198 samples. Sequence comparisons revealed that these 2198 samples likely belonged to 159 known species in 56 different genera, 31 families, 11 orders, 2 classes, and 2 phyla. Significantly, 51.13% of these samples had sequence similarities to known species at lower than 97%, likely representing new taxa. Further phylogenetic analyses on several common mushroom groups including 1536 internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences suggested the existence of 20 new (cryptic) species in these groups. The extensive new and cryptic species diversity in wild mushroom markets in Yunnan calls for greater attention for the conservation and utilization of these resources. Our results on both the distinct barcode sequences and the distributions of these sequences should facilitate new mushroom species discovery and forensic authentication of high-valued mushrooms and contribute to the scientific inventory for the management of wild mushroom markets.","We thank Esber Dai and Lei Cai for the invitation.

These are known to play key roles in host defense system and also in metastasis. Many new sources have been explored for the occurrence of lectins during the last few years. Numerous novel lectins with unique specificities and exploitable properties have been discovered. Mushrooms have attracted a number of researchers in food and pharmaceuticals. Many species have long been used in traditional Chinese medicines or functional foods in Japan and other Asian countries. A number of bioactive constituents have been isolated from mushrooms including polysaccharides, polysaccharopeptides, polysaccharide-protein complexes, proteases, ribonucleases, ribosome inactivating proteins, antifungal proteins, immunomodulatory proteins, enzymes, lectins, etc. Mushroom lectins are endowed with mitogenic, antiproliferative, antitumor, antiviral, and immune stimulating potential.

2983,pub.1053756526,10.1177/0269881106075590,17446200,,,An investigation of the subjective experiences of sex after alcohol or drug intoxication,"Despite long-standing concern over the sexual health of the population there has been little work undertaken in the UK investigating sexual risk taking and sexual behaviours in the context of substance use. To investigate this further, 270 non-drug treatment seeking members of the public aged between 18 and 66 were administered a questionnaire containing the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST), the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), the Sexual Risks Scale and Attitudes toward condom use (SRSA), the Sexual Sensation Seeking Scale (SSSS); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions pertaining to sexual episodes proximal to substance use. The population reported a varied history of substances and despite there not being self-awareness of problematic drug use, 39.4% reported above the cut-off mark of six on the DAST. An even greater percentage (57.8%) reported a score above eight on the AUDIT indicating hazardous or harmful drinking behaviour. The substance most often associated with sexual episodes was alcohol, followed by cannabis and ecstasy, and all were most frequently consumed in private houses. Sexual activity after drug use was most frequently circumstantial (i.e. the individual hadn't taken the substance for the specific purposes of sex), and was significantly associated with use of cannabis and ecstasy. The second most frequently reported association between drug use and sex was facilitation of a sexual encounter (i.e. to lower sexual inhibitions, increase self esteem and confidence), which was associated with use of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy. Although it was not possible to identify differences in subjective sexual changes after use of particular drugs, subjects reported that compared to sex after alcohol, sex on other drugs was more pleasurable and satisfying, with a greater perception of interpersonal contact with the partner and a greater willingness to sexually experiment. However, this latter change was not associated with changes in the type of sexual activity engaged in. Regression analysis revealed that the greatest subjective changes in sexual experiences were reported by younger participants who had ingested either ecstasy or cannabis prior to the sexual episode. These results are discussed in the context of sexual risk taking and suggest areas of intervention focus which may address substance use and sexual risk taking together.",,,Journal of Psychopharmacology,,SAGE Publications,"0269-8811, 1461-7285",Adult; Affect; Aged; Alcoholic Intoxication; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Risk-Taking; Sexual Behavior; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Unsafe Sex,04/08/2006,2006,04/08/2006,2007-07,21,5,525-537,Closed,Article,"Sumnall, H.R.; Beynon, C.M.; Conchie, S.M.; Riley, S.C.E.; Cole, J.C.","Sumnall, H.R.

The current standard of care for these disorders involves treatment with psychiatric medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), so it will be important to understand drug-drug interactions between MDMA or psilocybin and psychiatric medications.MethodsIn accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we queried the MEDLINE database via PubMed for publications of human studies in English spanning between the first synthesis of psilocybin (1958) and December 2020. We used 163 search terms containing 22 psychiatric medication classes, 135 specific psychiatric medications, and 6 terms describing MDMA or psilocybin.ResultsForty publications were included in our systematic review: 26 reporting outcomes from randomized controlled studies with healthy adults, 3 epidemiologic studies, and 11 case reports. Publications of studies describe interactions between MDMA (N = 24) or psilocybin (N = 5) and medications from several psychiatric drug classes: adrenergic agents, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, NMDA antagonists, psychostimulants, and several classes of antidepressants. We focus our results on pharmacodynamic, physiological, and subjective outcomes of drug-drug interactions.ConclusionsAs MDMA and psilocybin continue to move through the FDA drug development process, this systematic review offers a compilation of existing research on psychiatric drug-drug interactions with MDMA or psilocybin.","The authors thank Paul Bonney and Jason Jarria for assisting in abstract review.

They mostly consist of basidiomycetes, but also include some ascomycetes. Mycology in Pakistan is still in its infancy, but there have been many historical reports and checklists of macrofungi occurrence from its 15 ecoregions, which range from Himalayan alpine grasslands and subtropical pine forests to deserts and xeric shrublands. In this work, we searched and reviewed the historical literature and the GenBank database for compiling a comprehensive list of macrofungi reported from Pakistan to date. We recorded 1,293 species belonging to 411 genera, 115 families and 24 orders. These occurrences were updated taxonomically following the classification system currently proposed in the Index Fungorum website. The highest represented order by taxon number is Agaricales (47%) with 31 families, 146 genera and 602 species, followed by Polyporales (11%), Russulales (9%) and Pezizales (8%). Genera occurrence reported therein are presented for each ecoregion to the best of our ability given the data. We also discussed the currently known macrofungi diversity between different ecoregions in Pakistan. Overall, this work should serve as a solid foundation for the inclusion of Pakistan macrofungi in global biodiversity and conservation studies.",,,MycoKeys,,Pensoft Publishers,"1314-4057, 1314-4049",,09/05/2022,2022,09/05/2022,,89,,171-233,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aman, Nourin; Khalid, Abdul Nasir; Moncalvo, Jean-Marc","Aman, Nourin (Department of Botany, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore, 54590, Pakistan, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan; Department of Natural History, Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queen’s Park, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2C6, Canada, Department of Natural History, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada); Khalid, Abdul Nasir (Department of Botany, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore, 54590, Pakistan, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan); Moncalvo, Jean-Marc (Department of Natural History, Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queen’s Park, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2C6, Canada, Department of Natural History, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto, 25 Willcocks Street, Ontario M5S 3B2, Canada, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada)","Aman, Nourin (University of the Punjab; Royal Ontario Museum)","Aman, Nourin (University of the Punjab; Royal Ontario Museum); Khalid, Abdul Nasir (University of the Punjab); Moncalvo, Jean-Marc (Royal Ontario Museum; University of Toronto)",Royal Ontario Museum; University of Toronto; University of the Punjab,grid.421647.2; grid.17063.33; grid.11173.35,Toronto; Toronto; Lahore,Ontario; Ontario; Punjab,Canada; Canada; Pakistan,,,,,,0,0,,,5,https://mycokeys.pensoft.net/article/81148/download/pdf/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147754560,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,

The proceedings are synthesized in this article. Although mushrooms have long been regarded as health-promoting foods, research specific to their role in a healthful diet and in health promotion has advanced in the past decade. The earliest mushroom cultivation was documented in China, which remains among the top global mushroom producers, along with the United States, Italy, The Netherlands, and Poland. Although considered a vegetable in dietary advice, mushrooms are fungi, set apart by vitamin B-12 in very low quantity but in the same form found in meat, ergosterol converted with UV light to vitamin D2, and conjugated linoleic acid. Mushrooms are a rare source of ergothioneine as well as selenium, fiber, and several other vitamins and minerals. Some preclinical and clinical studies suggest impacts of mushrooms on cognition, weight management, oral health, and cancer risk. Preliminary evidence suggests that mushrooms may support healthy immune and inflammatory responses through interaction with the gut microbiota, enhancing development of adaptive immunity, and improved immune cell functionality. In addition to imparting direct nutritional and health benefits, analysis of U.S. food intake survey data reveals that mushrooms are associated with higher dietary quality. Also, early sensory research suggests that mushrooms blended with meats and lower sodium dishes are well liked and may help to reduce intakes of red meat and salt without compromising taste. As research progresses on the specific health effects of mushrooms, there is a need for effective communication efforts to leverage mushrooms to improve overall dietary quality.","The Mushroom Council and authors dedicate the Mushrooms and Health Summit Proceedings to our friend and colleague John A.

Native healers of the Orinoco and Amazon basins have used traditionally ayahuasca as a healing tool for multiple purposes, particularly to treat psychological disorders in the patients, with some beneficial effects experimentally and clinically validated. Recently, several syncretic religions, as the “União de Vegetal” (UDV) group in Brazil, have been spread around the world. The use of ayahuasca has been popularized by internet and smart-shops, bringing the psychoactive substance to new highs, emerging new “ayahuasqueros.” Ayahuasca has alkaloids as β-carbolines and dimethyltryptamines, which inhibit the monoamine oxidase and active the 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor, respectively, resulting in hallucinations in the users. Ayahuasca induces a psychedelic change in the anteroposterior coupling of the electrophysiological brain oscillations in humans. Traditional ayahuasca beverage is generating pharmacological, commercial and spiritual interest among the scientific community, government people, and different populations worldwide. The goal of this article is to report about the uses, chemistry and biological activities of ayahuasca.Graphical Abstract","We are grateful to the PRODEP-SEP Postdoctoral Fellowship at Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana (UAM) to EPEA (project number 14612857).

Popular analgesics, cold medicine and antihistamines contain psychedelic substances, such as dextromethorphan (DXM), pseudoephedrine/ephedrine, codeine (methylmorphine), dimenhydrinate, paracetamol (acetaminophren) and others. Cases of fatal addiction to dextromethorphan, one of the active substances contained in medicines, e.g., the common cold, have been reported. The test results cited by the authors clearly indicate that the use of OTC drugs, whose turnover is not controlled is a domain of females. The extent of use of drugs not prescribed by a doctor has remained for many years at a constant level. The most common poisonings with OTC drugs are caused by those that affect the respiratory system or exert analgesic or antipyretic effects. They are also used in attempted suicides, especially among females. Analyzing poisonings caused by OTC medications their seasonality has been observed. Their number increases during spring-autumn. A territorial differentiation in areas of OTC drug trade in terms of their quantities, with the predominance of southern regions is also noted. Intoxication with psychoactive substances causes the deterioration of relations between young people. In the reviewed studies there is no detailed information on the composition of non-prescription medicines. Moreover, young people have easy access to mushroom fungi, growing in nearby forests and meadows that may have hallucinogenic effects and are available in pharmacies and on the Internet.

Other published studies (e.g., of healthy volunteers, survey studies, case reports, neuroimaging) were also considered for review.ResultsPublished studies since 1991 largely support the hypothesis that small numbers of treatments with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can offer significant and sustained alleviation to symptoms of multiple psychiatric conditions. No serious adverse events attributed to psychedelic therapy have been reported. Existing studies have several limitations, including small sample sizes, inherent difficulty in blinding, relatively limited follow-up, and highly screened treatment populations.ConclusionsSubstantial data have been gathered in the past 30 years suggesting that psychedelics are a potent treatment for a variety of common psychiatric conditions, though the ideal means of employing these substances to minimize adverse events and maximize therapeutic effects remains controversial.

The definition and diagnostic features of ""Flashback"" and HPPD remained often unclear and since the 1960 s interchangeable.
METHODS: Relevant literature was identified by means of a computerized MEDLINE search including the years 1994-2014. Finally 75 journal articles out were included in the review.
RESULTS: Consistent with the ICD-10 (F16.70) definition ""Flashback"" is often used to describe brief visual perceptual, mood, and altered states of consciousness effects reminiscent of acute hallucinogen intoxication effects. Many users regard flashback phenomena as benign and even pleasant. HPPD is described in DSM-5 as a visual perceptual disorder, sometimes persisting for months or years causing severe individual distress. The prevalence of flashback and HPPD is unknown. It is considered to be remarkable in view of the relatively few case reports published out of millions of hallucinogen users since the 1960 s and 1970 s. Despite a multitude of etiological and therapeutic approaches the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HPPD remain elusive. At present HPPD appears to be further a DSM-5-genuine but still puzzling disorder.

One of the recurring questions is whether classification is mainly based on the “inherent structure of biological reality” or on cultural, especially utilitarian needs. So far, studies about ethnobotanical classification have mainly been done in indigenous societies. Comparable data from industrialized countries are scarce. In this paper, folkbotanical classification data from the Napf region in central Switzerland is analysed and cross-culturally compared.MethodsStructured and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 adults and children chosen by random sampling. Descriptive statistics, t-tests and cultural domain analysis were used to analyze the data.ResultsClose to 500 folk taxa have been documented during field work. As life-form taxa appeared tree, bush, grass, herb, flower, and mushroom. Intermediate taxa mentioned regularly were sub-categories of the life form tree and bush, i.e. conifer, deciduous tree, fruit tree, stone fruits, pomaceous fruits, and berry bush. The rank of the folk generic was by far the largest with 316 taxa (85.4% monotypical). The specific rank contained 145 taxa, the varietal 14 taxa. The 475 generic, specific and varietal folk taxa could be assigned to 298 wild growing plant species, which make up 28.13% of the local flora, and to 213 cultivated plant species, subspecies and cultivars.Morphology, mainly life-form, fruits, leaves, and flowers, was the most important criterion for classifying plants. Other important criteria were their use (mainly edibility) and habitat (mainly meadow, forest and garden). The three criteria emerged spontaneously out of open questioning.ConclusionThe classification system of the Napf region is comparable to classification systems of indigenous societies, both in its shallow hierarchical structure and in the amount of recognized taxa.The classification of plants was mainly guided by morphology, habitat and use. The three aspects seem to be mutually linked for certain plant groups, which results in always the same groups, independent from the different sorting criteria. Sensory perception allows for a broader explanation of the known coincidence of morphology and use groups.","We would like to thank our interview partners warmly for their time and goodwill, Anna and Maja Monnot for board and lodging and many inside-informations during fieldwork, Franz Huber for redesigning the Anthropac cluster diagram, Susanne Grasser for general exchange of ideas, Elisabeth Danner for the help with the identification of species, Rosmarie and Peter Küchel for the careful affixing of the voucher specimens and three anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and suggestions on additional literature.",,Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine,,Springer Nature,1746-4269,"Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Child; Culture; Ecology; Ethnobotany; Female; Flowers; Folklore; Fruit; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Plant Leaves; Plants; Plants, Edible; Switzerland; Young Adult",14/03/2015,2015,14/03/2015,2015-12,11,1,13,All OA; Gold,Article,"Poncet, Anna; Vogl, Christian R; Weckerle, Caroline S","Poncet, Anna (Department of Sustainable Agricultural Systems, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna, (BOKU), Gregor-Mendel-Strasse 33, A-1180, Vienna, Austria); Vogl, Christian R (Department of Sustainable Agricultural Systems, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna, (BOKU), Gregor-Mendel-Strasse 33, A-1180, Vienna, Austria); Weckerle, Caroline S (Institute of Systematic Botany, University of Zürich, Zollikerstrasse 107, CH-8008, Zürich, Switzerland)","Weckerle, Caroline S (University of Zurich)","Poncet, Anna (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences); Vogl, Christian R (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences); Weckerle, Caroline S (University of Zurich)",University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences; University of Zurich,grid.5173.0; grid.7400.3,Vienna; Zurich,; ,Austria; Switzerland,,,,,,8,5,0.21,2.01,,https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1746-4269-11-13,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015727001,"42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 4208 Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine; 44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology",,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,

This is due in part to the recognition of the value of traditional medical systems, particularly of Asian origin, and the identification of medicinal plants from indigenous pharmacopeias that have been shown to have significant healing power, either in their natural state or as the source of new pharmaceuticals. Generally these formulations are considered moderate in efficacy and thus less toxic than most pharmaceutical agents. In the Western world, in particular, the developing concept that 'natural' is better than 'chemical' or 'synthetic' has led to the evolution of Neo-Western herbalism that is the basis of an ever expanding industry. In the US, often guised as food, or food supplements, known as nutriceuticals, these formulations are readily available for those that wish to self-medicate. Within this system, in particular, are plants that lack ethnomedical verification of efficacy or safety. Unfortunately there is no universal regulatory system in place that insures that any of these plant remedies are what they say they are, do what is claimed, or most importantly are safe. Data will be presented in this context, outlining how adulteration, inappropriate formulation, or lack of understanding of plant and drug interactions have led to adverse reactions that are sometimes life-threatening or lethal.",,,Journal of Ethnopharmacology,,Elsevier,"0378-8741, 1872-7573",Female; Humans; Pharmacokinetics; Phytotherapy,2001-05,2001,,2001-05,75,02-Mar,141-164,Closed,Article,"Elvin-Lewis, Memory","Elvin-Lewis, Memory (Department of Biology, Washington University, Box 1137, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, USA)",,"Elvin-Lewis, Memory (Washington University in St. Louis)",Washington University in St. Louis,grid.4367.6,St Louis,Missouri,United States,,,,,,174,25,3.29,25.06,7,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019606579,"32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4208 Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine",,,5.1 Pharmaceuticals,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

CE's appeal was that it was fast, used very small amounts of sample and reagents, was extremely versatile, and was able to separate large and small analytes, whether neutral or charged. Because of this versatility, numerous methods have been developed for analytes that are of clinical interest. Other than molecular diagnostic and forensic laboratories CE has not been able to make a major impact in the United States. In contrast, in Europe and Japan an increasing number of clinical laboratories are using CE. Now that automated multicapillary instruments are commercially available along with cost-effective test kits, CE may yet be accepted as an instrument that will be routinely used in the clinical laboratories.

However, basic information on their diversity, taxonomy, and general biology has suffered from a lack of research. This is due in part to uncertainty about the regulations that may or may not apply based on the presumed presence of the controlled substances psilocybin and psilocin, even though they have been empirically confirmed in only a handful of Psilocybe species. In this study, we reviewed what is known about the chemistry of Psilocybe spp., examined 94 Psilocybe museum specimens by DNA barcoding, and quantified the amount of psilocybin, psilocin, and their related tryptamine alkaloids in museum specimens spanning five decades of three common species (Psilocybe cubensis, P. cyanescens, and P. semilanceata) using hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). Our data show that, with the exception of a few well-known species, the taxonomic accuracy of species-level identifications of museum collections is highly unreliable. Furthermore, 13% of specimens identified as Psilocybe were incorrectly identified at the genus level. Our data also support species- and time-dependent decay of psilocybin and psilocin, with 25% of specimens more than 10 years old having no detectable quantities of these controlled substances. Moreover, metabolomic analysis of the widely cultivated P. cubensis across tissue types and multiple harvests indicate there are possibly thousands of other compounds present in addition to psilocybin/psilocin, at least some of which may be bioactive, complicating whole organism-based therapeutic and recreational uses. Taken together, our study undermines commonly held assumptions about the accuracy of names and presence of controlled substances in fungarium specimens identified as Psilocybe spp., and reveals that our understanding of the chemical diversity of psychedelic mushrooms is woefully incomplete. These results have broader implications for regulatory policies pertaining to the storage and sharing of fungarium specimens as well as the use of psychedelic mushrooms for recreation and therapy.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Bradshaw, Alexander James; Dentinger, Bryn; Backman, Talia; Ramírez-Cruz, Virginia; Forrister, Dale; Winter, Jaclyn; Furci, Giuliana; Stamets, Paul; Guzmán-Dávalos, Laura","Bradshaw, Alexander James (); Dentinger, Bryn (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Backman, Talia (University of Utah); Ramírez-Cruz, Virginia (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Forrister, Dale (University of Utah); Winter, Jaclyn (University of Utah); Furci, Giuliana (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Stamets, Paul (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Guzmán-Dávalos, Laura (affiliation not provided to SSRN)",,"Bradshaw, Alexander James (); Dentinger, Bryn (); Backman, Talia (University of Utah); Ramírez-Cruz, Virginia (); Forrister, Dale (University of Utah); Winter, Jaclyn (University of Utah); Furci, Giuliana (); Stamets, Paul (); Guzmán-Dávalos, Laura ()",University of Utah,grid.223827.e,Salt Lake City,Utah,United States,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145795245,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Ethnomycological studies among the Indian tribes of Mexico - the Aztecs and the Chichimecas - revealed the mushrooms to be hallucinogenic. Chemists from a leading Pharmaceutical company took over, isolated and described the mushroom alkaloid psilocybin, that upon dephosphorylation after collection of the mushroom or in the human body, form psilocin that is the active hallucinogenic compound. For a long time psilocybin/psilocin was expected to become a constituent of psychedelic drugs useful for treatment of specific psychoses. As the effect of psilocybin/psilocin resembles that of LSD the isolated compound, as well as mushrooms containing the compound, became popular among recreational users of hallucinogenic drugs in Western America, and from there the habit of using these mushrooms have spread around the world. Psilocybin/psilocin is legally prohibited in many countries which usually treat the compound as a narcotic drug. Some countries also prohibit the use of some or all psilocybin-containing mushrooms. In this respect, the legal situation differs between Nordic countries. Although psilocybin-containing mushrooms are not what Nordic mushroom pickers are trying to find as food or food supplement, there is a risk, admittedly small, that these mushrooms accidentally will be collected. At the present situation, this may be a legal problem in some Nordic countries. This document aims at identifying when this might be the case without going into legal interpretations.",,,TemaNord,,Nordic Council of Ministers,0908-6692,,19/05/2009,2009,,19/05/2009,,,,All OA; Green,Monograph,"Andersson, Christer; Gry, Jørn; Kristinsson, Jakob","Andersson, Christer (); Gry, Jørn (); Kristinsson, Jakob ()",,"Andersson, Christer (); Gry, Jørn (); Kristinsson, Jakob ()",,,,,,,,,,,34,11,,4.07,,http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:701064/FULLTEXT01,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107183712,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,Complementary and Integrative Health,,,,,C22 Anthropology and Development Studies,3 Good Health and Well Being

1857,pub.1068140002,10.1615/intjmedmushrooms.v7.i3.540,,,,The Known Hallucinogenic Species of Psilocybe (Agaricomycetideae) in the World: Traditional Uses and Distribution,"A discussion of the known species of Psilocybe is presented with special attention to those possessing hallucinogenic effects. Guzman in 2005 considered 227 species, 144 of them belonging to hallucinogenic mushrooms. It is interesting to observe that 718 names have been proposed as Psilocybe in the literature and that Guzman, in 1983, accepted only 144 species in the genus, of which 91 were considered hallucinogenic. Another important observation is that more than 80 species of Psilocybe have been described by Guzman from almost all continents since 1968. This latter observation shows the lack of studies in the genus in contrast with the oldest original studies by Fries in 1821 and 1836, and by Ricken in 1915. Genera considered in Psilocybe, now independent are Hypholoma, Galerina, Melanotus, Naucoria, Panaeolus, Pholiota, Psathyrella, and Stropharia, among others. Modern studies in Psilocybe began with Singer in 1949; however, it was with the discovery of hallucinogenic mushrooms in Mexico in 1956 that the interest in the genus began. Modern studies in Psilocybe were also contributed by Bon and Roux in 2003, Noordeloosin 1999 and 2001,and Peglerin 1977, 1983, and 1986. Noordeloos added the genera Hypholoma, Melanotus, and Stropharia in Psilocybe, which a long time ago were considered independent from Psilocybe. The hallucinogenic species in Psilocybe were considered by Singer and Smith in 1958 in the section Caerulescentes, which was distinguished by the bluing feature in the basidioma. However, Guzman, in 1983, divided this section in 10 of all of the 18 considered in the genus, including some modifications, as well as a new section discussed by him, both in 1995 and 2004. Guzman's classification is based on the form and structure of spores and the presence or absence of cystidia, including the bluing feature of the basidioma, and its farinaceous taste and flavor, although in some species—e.g., P. mexicana R. Heim and P. semilanceata (Fr.) P.Kumm. It is sometimes difficult to see the bluing reaction because it depends on the development of the basidioma. Moncalvo et al. (2002), in a molecular study of several Agaricales, divided Psilocybe into two genera: Psilocybe s.s. and Psychedelia Moncalvo et al., the latter genera including all hallucinogenic species that have psilocybin and psilocin. This means that there is, at the present, a discussion about what makes up the taxonomic point of view of the hallucinogenic species of Psilocybe. Certainly the fact that all of them are bluing weigh heavily in the discussion, but this feature is also present in other mushrooms, as is found in Copelandia and some Boletaceous fungi. In addition, psilocybin and psilocin are present in other genera such as Copelandia, Gymnopilus, and Pluteus. Related to traditional uses of hallucinogenic species, in Mexico several groupts of Indians still use these mushrooms in religious ceremonies. There are probably some tribes in Papua New Guinea that use Psilocybe kumaenorum R.Heim for religious purposes, as reported by Heim in 1967. Some primitive tribes in North Africa probably used some unknown Psilocybe in traditional ceremonies, as shown by Samorini in 2001 in primitive paintings found in a cave. Unfortunately, after the discovery of hallucinogenic mushrooms in Mexico, young people started to use this drug for recreational purposes. This changed the traditional uses of hallucinogens in Mexico, and an economic purpose was found in the ceremonial uses. Also, the easy culturing of these fungi made an illegal trade of the hallucinogens possible in the US, Europe, and Japan, in spite of the fact that the hallucinogenic mushrooms were forbidden by several governments. Species of Psilocybe are distributed in all the continents. However, Mexico is the country with the highest number of species, 53, while Europe has only 16 and the US and Canada, 22. In Latin America, excluding Mexico, there are around 60 species. Africa has only four species. In Asia (Japan, Nepal, Vietnam, Thailand, and Java) there are 15 species (besides five that Horak and Desjardin have under study). In Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Gvinea, and New Caledonia there are 19 species. It is possible to see that the tropics and subtropics in the world have the majority of the species, with more than 100, in comparison with temperate regions, which have around 40 species. Furthermore, it is supposed that the origin of the hallucinogenic species of Psilocybe started in the Austral hemisphere in the old Gondwanian Continent. Another important observation in the distribution of the species is that the majority was found in hygrophytic or mesophytic forests, known also as subtropical cloud forests, and grew in humid mountains at 900-1400 m altitude close to the sea. In Mexico it was observed that more than 90% of the known species are in this kind of vegetation. Psilocybe antioquesis described from this kind of vegetation in Colombia recently was found in Mexico and in Cambodia in the same vegetation. An example of an abnormal distribution of a temperate species is Psilocybe semilanceata, very common in Europe, common only in the northwest of the US, unknown in Mexico, and reported one time from Chile and New Zealand. Considering all of the above observations and more, the author is in the process of preparing the second edition of his monograph of 1983 on the genus Psilocybe.",,,International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms,,Begell House,"1521-9437, 1940-4344",,2005,2005,,2005,7,3,410-411,All OA; Bronze,Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,,https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/download/article/193b9f91492d1c45/IJM 0703 (410-411).pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068140002,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

The role of altered states of consciousness in the production of geometric and figurative art by prehistoric cultures in Africa and Europe has been hotly debated. Helvenston and Bahn have tried to refute the most famous hypothesis, Lewis-Williams’ neuropsychological model, by claiming that appropriate visual hallucinations required the ingestion of LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline, while arguing that none of these compounds were available to the cultures in question. We present here mycological arguments that tell another story. A prehistoric worldwide distribution of the mushroom genus Psilocybe, and therefore of psilocybin, is supported by the existence of endemic species in America, Africa, and Europe, the disjunct distribution of sister species, and the possibility of long-distance spore dispersal. It is more difficult to point to instances of actual prehistoric ritual use in Africa and Europe, but there are a growing number of suggestive findings.","Tom Froese and Laura Guzmán-Dávalos dedicate this article to the memory of Gastón Guzmán, who sadly did not live to see its publication.

Conidiogenesis in Pholiota aurivella (Batsch) P. Kumm., Pholiota gummosa (Lasch) Singer, and Pholiota squarrosa (Batsch) P. Kumm. followed a second mode, distinguished by straight conidiogenous hyphae, sympodially proliferating geniculate conidiophores, and coloured, swollen conidia formed on older mycelia. These two modes also differed concerning the number of nuclei in the conidia. Pholiota alnicola (Fr.) Singer and Pholiota tuberculosa (Schaeff.) P. Kumm. possessed specific modes of conidiogenesis that deviated from the two prevalent modes described above. Careful analysis of anamorph descriptions compiled from literature supports these modes and allows conidia to be distinguished from nondetaching hyphal swellings that have also been designated as conidia in the past.","We are grateful to Walter Gams for critically reading an earlier draft of the manuscript, Batrice Senn-Irlet and Gerhard Zschieschang for reviewing the identification of a specimen, and Bayer Health Care for financial support.",,Botany,,Canadian Science Publishing,"1916-2790, 1916-2804",,21/05/2008,2008,21/05/2008,2008-06,86,6,551-566,Closed,Article,"Walther, Grit; Wei, Michael","Walther, Grit (CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre, P.O.

Although native Americans in Central and South America consumed psilocybe mushrooms for thousands of years, the first European record of their use was by a Spanish priest in the 16th century who recorded their use by the Aztec Indians. In 1957, Wasson published his own experience with the mushroom. This was soon followed by the isolation and recreational use of psilocybin, which was designated as a controlled substance in the United States in 1968. In the UK, psilocybin is present in the indigenous mushroom Psilocybe semilanceata (magic mushroom; liberty cap). Other mushroom species, such as Stropharia cubensis and Conocybe spp, also contain psilocybin. Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in the United States because they contain the Schedule I drugs psilocybin and psilocin. At high doses (5.0 g), psilocybin causes open eye hallucinations. The hallucinogenic and sympathomimetic properties of this agent can last for up to 6 hours.

Ketamine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in a new class of antidepressants, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is undergoing phase III clinical trials for post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are being investigated in several phase II and phase I clinical trials. Hence, the concept of psychedelics as therapeutics may be incorporated into modern society. Here, we discuss the main known neurobiological therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelics, which are thought to be mediated by the effects of these compounds on the serotonergic (via 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors) and glutamatergic [via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors] systems. We focus on 1) neuroplasticity mediated by the modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin-, brain-derived neurotrophic factor-, and early growth response-related pathways; 2) immunomodulation via effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, nuclear factor ĸB, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 1, 6, and 10 production and release; and 3) modulation of serotonergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and norepinephrinergic receptors, transporters, and turnover systems. We discuss arising concerns and ways to assess potential neurobiological changes, dependence, and immunosuppression. Although larger cohorts are required to corroborate preliminary findings, the results obtained so far are promising and represent a critical opportunity for improvement of pharmacotherapies in psychiatry, an area that has seen limited therapeutic advancement in the last 20 years. Studies are underway that are trying to decouple the psychedelic effects from the therapeutic effects of these compounds. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychedelic compounds are emerging as potential novel therapeutics in psychiatry. However, understanding of molecular mechanisms mediating improvement remains limited. This paper reviews the available evidence concerning the effects of psychedelic compounds on pathways that modulate neuroplasticity, immunity, and neurotransmitter systems. This work aims to be a reference for psychiatrists who may soon be faced with the possibility of prescribing psychedelic compounds as medications, helping them assess which compound(s) and regimen could be most useful for decreasing specific psychiatric symptoms.","We thank Dr. Franco Recchia and Photo Grafic (www.photo-grafic.it) for help with the preparation of the figures.

These substances are controlled in almost every country in the world, so the use, possession, cultivation, and sale of magic mushrooms are prohibited in whole or in part. Despite this, the abuse of magic mushrooms continues and can put at risk the life of the consumer and society in general if the consumer behaves in an unsafe manner. The number of mushroom species is very high, making it difficult to correctly identify them based only on physical and morphological characteristics. Therefore, there is a need to develop non-destructive mushrooms analysis methods that have less response time and higher discrimination ability. The present work used Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR-ATR) Spectroscopy to study 64 mushroom samples from different genera including hallucinogenic, edible, and toxic species. In addition, this study used Orthogonal Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), using SIMCA chemometric software to analyse the obtained infrared (IR) spectra. The main molecular vibrations of the components of the fungus were successfully identified by IR spectroscopy. Although the specific bands corresponding to psilocybin or psilocin could not be assigned in the spectra, the regression method was able to discriminate the various species. Hallucinogenic mushrooms were well separated from other species, allowing the method to be used as an initial screening technique to determine whether or not the seized mushrooms are of forensic interest.",Cátia Esteves would like to thank Erasmus + programme of the European Union for her “Learning Agreement for Traineeships” and the CINQUIFOR investigation group for the assistance and technical support.

1706,pub.1049126329,10.1016/s0007-1536(86)80019-5,,,,Assessing natural relationships in the Basidiomycetes by DNA analysis,"DNA was isolated from mycelia and basidiomes of 44 different mushrooms and characterized by physical methods and reassociation kinetics. The GC contents of the genera Hypholoma, Pholiota, Stropharia, Psilocybe and Kuehneromyces ranged from 42.2 to 45.9 mol%. The Polyporus species gave GC contents between 50.4 and 54.1 mol %. The average genome sizes of species within the Stropharia aeruginosa complex (S. aeruginosa, S. caerulea, S. albocyanea and S. ochrocyanea) were approximately 22.2 × 109 dalton; 12–15% of the genomes consisted of repetitive DNA. DNA-DNA hybridization studies were performed by a fast spectroscopic method and on membrane filters using radioactively labelled DNA. DNA-DNA hybridizations were performed in the genera Polyporus, Psilocybe, Stropharia and Kuehneromyces. The spectroscopic method was used for the first time for investigations of the relatedness of Basidiomycetes. Good agreement between both DNA-DNA hybridization methods was observed only at high homology values. It was demonstrated on whole-cell DNA that both methods are useful for investigations of close relationships at the species level. Homology values between 95 and 100% obtained with the spectroscopic DNA-DNA hybridization method indicated conspecificity, whereas homology values between 40 and 60% indicated distant relatedness. Stropharia albocyanea and S. ochrocyanea were considered conspecific due to DNA-DNA homologies of close to 100%. The same was true for Stropharia squamosa (= Psilocybe squamosa) and S. thrausta (= Psilocybe squamosa var. thrausta).",,,Fungal Biology,,Elsevier,"1878-6146, 1469-8102, 0007-1536",,1986-09,1986,,1986-09,87,2,175-191,Closed,Article,"Jahnke, K.-D.; Bahnweg, G.","Jahnke, K.-D.

1646,pub.1153770143,10.1101/2022.12.13.520147,,,,Phylogenomics of the psychoactive mushroom genus Psilocybe and evolution of the psilocybin biosynthetic gene cluster,"Abstract  Psychoactive mushrooms in the genus Psilocybe have immense cultural value and have been used for centuries in Mesoamerica. Despite a recent surge in interest in these mushrooms due to emerging evidence that psilocybin, the main psychoactive compound, is a promising therapeutic for a variety of mental illnesses, their phylogeny and taxonomy remain substantially incomplete. Moreover, the recent elucidation of the psilocybin biosynthetic gene cluster is known for only five species of Psilocybe , four of which belong to only one of two major clades. We set out to improve the phylogeny for Psilocybe using shotgun sequencing of 71 fungarium specimens, including 23 types, and conducting phylogenomic analysis using 2,983 single-copy gene families to generate a fully supported phylogeny. Molecular clock analysis suggests the stem lineage arose ∼66 mya and diversified ∼53 mya. We also show that psilocybin biosynthesis first arose in Psilocybe , with 4–5 possible horizontal transfers to other mushrooms between 40 and 22 mya. Moreover, predicted orthologs of the psilocybin biosynthetic genes revealed two distinct gene orders within the cluster that corresponds to a deep split within the genus, possibly consistent with the independent acquisition of the cluster. This novel insight may predict differences in chemistry between the two major clades of the genus, providing further resources for the development of novel therapeutics.","We acknowledge the Natural History Museum of Utah for its commitment to collaborative Science and the Genomics Core Facility, a part of the Health Sciences Cores at The University of Utah, for their input and high-quality work. Additionally, we acknowledge the numerous institutions that provided specimens for destructive sampling, many of which were rare and irreplaceable. Further, we wish to recognize the dedicated and hard work performed by Isabelle Galland and Talia A. Backman in their help processing many of these samples for DNA sequencing. Further, the authors wish to thank David Scott Flocken for his insight and thought- provoking conversations on the work generated here.

Alkaloids covered by our review come from mushrooms called “hallucinogenic.”Hallucinogenic compounds have been chemically identified in mushrooms belonging to various genera, e.g., Agrocybe, Amanita, Conocybe, Galerina, Gymnopilus, Hypholoma, Inocybe, Panaeolus, Psilocybe, Pholiotina, Pluteus, and Weraroa [J.W. Allen, Ethnomycol. J. Sacred Mushroom Stud. 9 (2012) 130–175]. One of the largest classes of alkaloids is indole alkaloids.Indoles are probably the most widely distributed heterocyclic compounds in nature having medicinal importance [K.N. Kumar et al., Molecules 18 (2013) 6620–6662]. Two of simple indole alkaloids: psilocin (3-[2 (dimethylamino)ethyl]-4-indolol) and psilocybin ([3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-1H-indol-4-yl] dihydrogen phosphate) are present in most psychedelic mushrooms. Psilocin is a serotonin agonist – psilocybin/psilocin caused effects are thought to be mediated mainly by activation of 5-HT2A receptor. Ligands for the 5-HT2A receptor may be extremely useful tools for future cognitive neuroscience research [D.E. Nichols, Pharmacol. Ther. 101 (2004) 131–181]. They are also other analogs of psilocybin: baeocystin, norbaeocystin, bufotenin, and aeruginascin that are found in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Bufotenin occur also in some animal species (genus Bufo) and plants. Some of the mushroom belonging to genera Gymnopilus and Pholiota were shown to possess bisnoryangonin and hispidin, alkaloids with antimicrobial [K. Shinto et al., J. Home Econ. Jpn. 58 (9) (2007) 563–568] and antioxidant [Lee In-K et al., Mycobiology, 36 (1) (2008) 55–59] activity. Also psychoactive species of genus Amanita, contain the alkaloids (muscimol, ibotenic acid, and muscazone) that react with neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. Isoxazoles, to which these alkaloids belong, have been found to inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels to control pain, enable the construction of tetracycline antibiotic derivatives, and as treatments for depression. The information within this review is intended to serve as a reference tool to better enable future research into important and fascinating area of pharmacognostic science as well as other parts of medical science.","The research is supported by Wroclaw Research Centre EIT+ under the project “Biotechnologies and Advanced Medical Technologies” – BioMed (POIG.01.01.02-02-003/08) financed from the European Regional Development Fund (Operational Programme Innovative Economy, 1.1.2).

Formerly they were used for religious and culture purposes. Those fungi belong mainly to the genera Conocybe, Copelandia, Panaeolus, Psilocybe and Stropharia. A number of these fungal species produce substances, like psilocybin, psilocin, ibotenic acid or muscimol. Because of their chemical similarity to naturally occurring neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA these substances, after ingestion, affect brain neurochemistry and by this induce hallucinations. This mini review presents the influence of psilocybin, psilocin, ibotenic acid and muscimol on the nervous system.

Ce sont de loin les syndromes les plus fréquemment rencontrés. Ils sont caractérisés par un délai entre la consommation de champignons et l'apparition des premiers signes cliniques inférieur à 6 heures, le plus souvent de 2-3 heures. Les toxines n'ont été que rarement identifiées. Le syndrome digestif est le plus fréquent et correspond à une atteinte digestive plus ou moins sévère. Le syndrome muscarinien est le syndrome le plus fréquent pouvant conduire en soins intensifs du fait du retentissement cardiocirculatoire ; le recours à l'atropine est parfois nécessaire. Le syndrome panthérinien associe une phase d'excitation (hallucinations) puis de dépression du système nerveux central. Le syndrome psilocybien correspond à un syndrome psychodysleptique proche de celui induit par le LSD. Le syndrome coprinien est un syndrome antabuse reproduisant les effets de l'association disulfirame-éthanol. Le syndrome paxillien correspond à une anémie hémolytique immunoallergique d'origine alimentaire. La prise en charge des syndromes mineurs est le plus souvent symptomatique, et la guérison est la règle. Des risques moins communs liés au contact avec les champignons (infection, allergie), ou à l'inverse bien médiatisés (contamination par métaux et radioéléments) sont décrits. Abstract The so-called minor syndromes represent the vast majority of mushroom poisonings. The toxic mechanism is functional, not cytotoxic, and the outcome is generally good. “Minor” syndromes are characterized by a time lapse between the mushroom ingestion and the first symptoms of less than 6 hours, generally 2-3 hours. The toxins are seldom identified. The gastrointestinal syndrome is the most frequent and corresponds to a more or less intense digestive irritation. The muscarine poisoning is the most severe, because of associated cardio-circulatory complications; treatment with atropine is sometimes useful. Pantherine syndrome associates an excitation (hallucinations) then a depression of the central nervous system. The hallucinogenic syndrome is close to the LSD-induced psychodysleptic syndrome. Coprine poisoning is an “antabuse” syndrome that reproduces all the symptoms of the disulfiram-ethanol interaction. Paxillus syndrome is an immuno-allergic haemolytic anaemia of food origin. Treatments of these “minor” syndromes are generally symptomatic. Some less common risks related to mushrooms (infection, allergy), or at the contrary much mediatized risks (contamination by metals and radio elements) are described.",,,EMC - Pathologie professionnelle et de l environnement,,Elsevier,1877-7856,,2006-01,2006,,2006-01,1,2,01-Dec,Closed,Article,"Saviuc, P.; Flesch, F.; Danel, V.","Saviuc, P.

Overall 14 different substances were identified as possible triggers of this cardiomyopathy.ConclusionTakotsubo cardiomyopathy could be triggered by the use or exposure to 14 drugs of abuse, chemical substances or animal poisons, which in most cases generate a sympathetic overstimulation. Thus it is recommended to consider this type of situation in patients presenting this kind of cardiomyopathy, especially in those where a physical or emotional trigger cannot be identified.","Al Comité para el Desarrollo de la Investigación (CODI) de la Universidad de Antioquia, por su apoyo económico en la convocatoria sostenibilidad (2014 a 2015), al grupo Promoción y Prevención Farmacéutica y al Programa Joven Investigador Colciencias-Universidad de Antioquia, que posibilita la participación y formación de la química farmacéutica Laura Cifuentes.",,Revista Colombiana de Cardiología,,"Publicidad Permanyer, SLU","0120-5633, 2357-3260",,2017-03,2017,,2017-03,24,2,117-127,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cifuentes, Laura; Amariles, Pedro","Cifuentes, Laura (Programa Joven investigadora Colciencias, Grupo de investigación, Promoción y Prevención Farmacéutica, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Amariles, Pedro (Departamento de Farmacia, Grupo de investigación Promoción y Prevención Farmacéutica, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia; Grupo de investigación en Atención Farmacéutica, Universidad de Granada, Granada, España)","Amariles, Pedro (University of Antioquia; University of Granada)","Cifuentes, Laura (University of Antioquia); Amariles, Pedro (University of Antioquia; University of Granada)",University of Antioquia; University of Granada,grid.412881.6; grid.4489.1,Medellín; Granada,; ,Colombia; Spain,Colciencias,,Colombia,,,0,0,,0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rccar.2016.05.015,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031458570,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,Cardiovascular; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Heart Disease; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Substance Misuse,Cardiovascular,,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

Depuis les années 2000, cette technique semble se répandre. Les avantages avancés par les consommateurs sont contradictoires : effets rapides (traduction en pharmacocinétique : libération immédiate, LI) ou effets prolongés (en pharmacocinétique : libération prolongée, LP). L’objectif était d’étudier la cinétique de dissolution du parachute in vitro et d’évaluer l’influence de la granulométrie de la substance, du papier utilisé et de l’alcool.MéthodesDes parachutes ont été réalisés avec 150mg d’acide acétylsalicylique pulvérisé (ASAp) et cristallisé (ASAc), à l’aide de papier à cigarette (PPC), de papier toilette (PPT) ; des gélules ont aussi été utilisées. Le test de dissolution évalue la vitesse à laquelle un principe actif (PA) incorporé dans une forme pharmaceutique se dissout dans un milieu proche des milieux biologiques. Une forme est dite LI quand 80 % du PA sont dissous en 120min. Test de dissolution : appareil Pharmatest® (vitesse rotation 75 tpm, T : 37°C, pH 2). De l’alcool à 40 % a été ajouté au milieu de dissolution.RésultatsAprès 2h, la dissolution de l’ASAc dans les gélules était de 90,6 % alors qu’elle était de 35–45 % dans les PPC (26 % pour ASAp) et de 100 % dans les PPT. En présence d’alcool, la dissolution de l’ASAc était de 100 % (PPC).DiscussionLe PPC agirait comme une forme LP, alors qu’en présence d’alcool, il agirait comme une forme LI, comme le PPT. C’est une information importante en terme de réduction des risques : le consommateur doit être conscient que le parachute peut agir avec une cinétique différente de celle escomptée et doit éviter de reprendre un parachute en l’absence d’effet immédiat.",,,Therapies,,Elsevier,"0040-5957, 1958-5578",,2017-02,2017,,2017-02,72,1,148,Closed,Article,"Daveluy, Amélie; Géniaux, Hélène; Matta, Marie-Noëlle; Baumevieille, Marie; Lazès-Charmettant, Aurélie; Haramburu, Françoise; Guéroult, Pascale","Daveluy, Amélie (Centre d’addictovigilance, service de pharmacologie médicale, bâtiment 1A, 1er étage, case 36, CHU, 146, rue Léo-Saignat, 33000 Bordeaux, France; Inserm U1219, Bordeaux, France); Géniaux, Hélène (Centre d’addictovigilance, service de pharmacologie médicale, bâtiment 1A, 1er étage, case 36, CHU, 146, rue Léo-Saignat, 33000 Bordeaux, France; Inserm U1219, Bordeaux, France); Matta, Marie-Noëlle (Laboratoire de technologies pharmaceutiques industrielles (LTPIB), université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France); Baumevieille, Marie (Centre d’addictovigilance, service de pharmacologie médicale, bâtiment 1A, 1er étage, case 36, CHU, 146, rue Léo-Saignat, 33000 Bordeaux, France; Inserm U1219, Bordeaux, France; Laboratoire de droit et économie pharmaceutiques, université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France); Lazès-Charmettant, Aurélie (CEID-Addictions, Bordeaux, France); Haramburu, Françoise (Centre d’addictovigilance, service de pharmacologie médicale, bâtiment 1A, 1er étage, case 36, CHU, 146, rue Léo-Saignat, 33000 Bordeaux, France; Inserm U1219, Bordeaux, France); Guéroult, Pascale (Laboratoire de technologies pharmaceutiques industrielles (LTPIB), université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France)","Daveluy, Amélie (; Bordeaux Population Health)","Daveluy, Amélie (Bordeaux Population Health); Géniaux, Hélène (Bordeaux Population Health); Matta, Marie-Noëlle (University of Bordeaux); Baumevieille, Marie (Bordeaux Population Health; University of Bordeaux); Lazès-Charmettant, Aurélie (); Haramburu, Françoise (Bordeaux Population Health); Guéroult, Pascale (University of Bordeaux)",University of Bordeaux; Bordeaux Population Health,grid.412041.2; grid.508062.9,Bordeaux; Bordeaux,; ,France; France,,,,,,0,0,,0,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084110737,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,,,,,,

This is the first reported use of chemiluminescence for the determination of these compounds. The special ability of the CAR technique to suppress background emission in peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence reactions provides a highly sensitive means of determination (the response to indole alkaloids is linear over two orders of magnitude and detection limits are in the picomole range).

Studies are also starting to be undertaken to explore the use of molecular data on fungi in the characterization of soils. In addition, where there are health concerns, possibly associated with mold growth in buildings, guidance is presented with respect to the collection of samples, and some caveats are given which must be considered in interpretation of data. Attention is drawn to pertinent publications which either appeared, or came to the attention of the authors, since the review they prepared in 2010. This is supplemented by examples from their own recent casework. In order to avoid valuable information being overlooked, there is a need for investigating officers, and those involved in forensic medicine, especially pathologists and toxicologists, to be aware of the evidential value of fungi. In particular, they should not overlook opportunities to recover spores from human remains, to examine any mold colonies growing on corpses, and to analyze gut contents for fungal material and spores.

Mushroom poisoning is mostly an accidental result of a mix-up between edible and toxic fungi. However, intentional ingestion of psychotropic (‘magic’) mushrooms has become a problem. Among thousands of mushroom species worldwide, fewer than a hundred are severely toxic. Most fungal toxins cause mild or moderate poisoning, often only gastroenteritis; the ingestion of a few species of extremely poisonous fungi defines the medical dimension of the problem. The most dreaded poisonings are those caused by cytotoxic fungi, for example amatoxins in death cap (Amanita phalloides) and destroying angel (Amanita virosa); both cause severe gastroenteritis and liver damage. Orellanine, occurring in certain Cortinarius spp., can induce severe and persistent kidney damage. Dramatic, but rarely lethal, effects are caused by fungi containing neurotoxins such as muscarine (Clitocybe and Inocybe spp.), psilocybin (Psilocybe and Panaeolus spp. – ‘magic’ mushrooms), isoxazoles (fly agaric, panther cap) and gyromitrin (false morels). Treatment is focused on general symptomatic and supportive care, although antidotes exist for fungi containing muscarine (atropine), gyromitrin (pyridoxine) and amatoxins (silibinin [silibinin is approved e.g. in Sweden and Germany (Legalon SIL D)], penicillin); the benefit of the latter has not yet been fully established.",Figures 1–4 were kindly provided by Mr Hans Marklund.,,Medicine,,Elsevier,"1357-3039, 1878-9390",,2016-02,2016,,2016-02,44,2,116-119,Closed,Article,"Persson, Hans","Persson, Hans (Hans Persson MD MDhc is Senior Physician and previous Director of the Swedish Poisons Information Centre, Stockholm, Sweden.

The Selva Pascuala mural, a work of post-Paleolithic rock art in Spain, contains fungoid figures herein hypothesized to depict neurotropic fungi, especially Psilocybe hispanica, a species that occurs in a neighboring region. This hypothesis is based on features of these figures related to fungal morphology, along with ethnographic analogy, and shamanistic explanations of rock art. If correct, this interpretation would support inference of prehistoric utilization of this fungus in the region.

Recently, Psilocybe also included non-hallucinogenic species that have since been shifted to the genus Deconica. Here, we reconstruct a multigene phylogeny for Psilocybe, Deconica, and other exemplars of the families Hymenogastraceae and Strophariaceae sensu stricto (s. str.), using three nuclear markers (nLSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and rpb1). Our results confirm the monophyly of Deconica within Strophariaceae s. str., as well as numerous robust infrageneric relationships. Psilocybe is also recovered as a monophyletic group in the Hymenogastraceae, in which two principal lineages are recognized, including several nested subgroups. Most sections of Psilocybe following classifications based on morphological features are not supported in these analyses. Ancestral character state reconstruction analyses suggest that basidiospore shape in frontal view and spore wall thickness, commonly used to characterize sections in Deconica and Psilocybe, are homoplastic. Chrysocystidia, sterile cells located in the hymenium, evolved on at least two occasions in the Strophariaceae s. str., including in a novel lineage of Deconica.","This work was supported by CONACYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología; project CONACYT-SEP-2003-C02-42957), University of Guadalajara, PIFI-2008 to 2011 (UDG-CA-23 &amp; CA-44); a grant from the US National Science Foundation to P.B Matheny, DEB-0949517; and Idea Wild.

Certains patients consommateurs chroniques quotidiens de cannabis, présentent de façon cyclique de fortes douleurs abdominales ainsi que des crises de nausées et de vomissements qui peuvent avoir de sévères conséquences et entraîner une hospitalisation. Ce travail vise à caractériser ce nouveau syndrome.Matériel et méthodeAnalyse des notifications reçues par le réseau des CEIP-A, recherche bibliographique en utilisant la méthode Prisma « cannabinoid hyperemesis » sans limitation de temps. Les articles mentionnant des cas rapportés ont été ensuite sélectionnés.RésultatsLes CEIP-A ont recueilli 26 cas dont 23 en 2015/2016, 2 en 2014 et 1 en 2013. Trente articles correspondant à 55 cas rapportés ont été publiés dans la littérature. Quinze articles ont été publiés depuis 2014. Tous ces cas ont une présentation clinique semblable. Les patients présentent régulièrement des périodes de crises espacées par des périodes calmes. Au cours de la crise, douleurs abdominales et vomissements incoercibles sont au premier plan du tableau clinique et peuvent entraîner des déshydratations sévères accompagnées de troubles de la concentration ionique sanguine. Les consommations moyennes de cannabis sont en général élevées. Ces crises sont difficilement contrôlables. La stratégie la plus efficace pour diminuer les symptômes semble être la prise de bains ou de douches chauds.ConclusionLe syndrome cannabinoïde est un syndrome récemment identifié. Plusieurs hypothèses expliquent son apparition récente, parmi lesquelles l’augmentation de la teneur en THC du cannabis et l’apparition des cannabinoïdes de synthèse. Les hypothèses neurobiologiques expliquant ce tableau sont encore controversées.

A wide range of conventional policies controls the availability of herbal products to the general public. The accomplishment of this depends on their derivation and their categorization as medicinals, drugs, botanicals, or dietary supplements. Herbal remedies used as medicines may be traditionally or serendipitously derived, varying in formulation, preparation and standardization, sometimes unreliable as to plant identification or to chemical composition, and depending on their cultural source, infrequently validated in conventional ways, as to efficacy or safety. The detection of adulterated or contaminated herbal products is not easy, because many policies prevent these events to be fully implemented and ways to identify the problems are not easy to achieve. The potential danger of using certain botanicals or their compounds is recognized. Use of herbal remedies by pregnant or nursing mothers can result in the transmission of certain phytochemicals to the fetus or infant. The capacity of children to absorb, distribute, metabolize, and excrete certain substances differs from that of adults. Herbal effects on absorption can also affect the bioavailability of antibiotics.",,,Advances in Food and Nutrition Research,,Elsevier,"1043-4526, 2213-6797","Child; Consumer Product Safety; Drug Contamination; Female; Government Regulation; Herb-Drug Interactions; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Internationality; Medicine, Traditional; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Pregnancy",2005,2005,,2005,50,J.

Psilocybe formerly classified in the genus Deconica were investigated using morphology, mating behaviour and RAPD analysis. Psilocybe inquilinus and P. crobula do not seem to be closely related. Based on the morphology, two varieties could be accommodated in P. subviscida namely as vars. subviscida and velata. The mating group of P. montana is characterized by rather thick-walled, dark spores with a fairly large germ-pore. Putative representatives of P. muscorum and P. physaloides freely interbreed with typical P. montana and, consequently, these taxa are considered to represent one variable species. The ex-type strain of P. chionophila did not mate with isolates of P. montana. One collection of P. chionophila from a lowland habitat, morphologically resembling P. montana was found to be interfertile with the ex-type strain of P. chionophila but not with P. montana.

There is resurgence in developing psychedelics to treat psychiatric disorders with high unmet clinical need. Many, but not all, psychedelics are schedule 1 controlled drugs (CDs), i.e., no approved medical use. For existing psychedelics in development, regulatory approval will require a move from schedule 1 to a CD schedule for drugs with medical use, i.e., schedules 2-5. Although abuse of the psychedelics is well documented, a systematic preclinical and clinical evaluation of the risks they pose in a medical-use setting does not exist. We describe the non-clinical tests required for a regulatory evaluation of abuse/dependence risks, i.e., drug-discrimination, intravenous self-administration and physical dependence liability. A synopsis of the existing data for the various types of psychedelics is provided and we describe our findings with psychedelic drugs in these models. FDA recently issued its guidance on abuse/dependence evaluation of drug-candidates (CDER/FDA, 2017). We critically review the guidance, discuss the impact this document will have on non-clinical abuse/dependence testing, and offer advice on how non-clinical abuse/dependence experiments can be designed to meet not only the expectations of FDA, but also other regulatory agencies. Finally, we offer views on how these non-clinical tests can be refined to provide more meaningful information to aid the assessment of the risks posed by CNS drug-candidates for abuse and physical dependence.

The Maya drank balché (a mixture of honey and extracts of Lonchocarpus) in group ceremonies to achieve intoxication. Ritual enemas and other psychoactive substances were also used to induce states of trance. Olmec, Zapotec, Maya and Aztec used peyote, hallucinogenic mushrooms (teonanacatl: Psilocybe spp.) and the seeds of ololiuhqui (Turbina corymbosa), that contain mescaline, psilocybin and lysergic acid amide, respectively. The skin of the toad Bufo spp. contains bufotoxins with hallucinogenic properties, and was used during the Olmec period. Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), wild tobacco (Nicotiana rustica), water lily (Nymphaea ampla) and Salvia divinorum were used for their psychoactive effects. Mushroom stones dating from 3000 BC have been found in ritual contexts in Mesoamerica. Archaeological evidence of peyote use dates back to over 5000 years. Several chroniclers, mainly Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, described their effects in the sixteenth century.ConclusionsThe use of psychoactive substances was common in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies. Today, local shamans and healers still use them in ritual ceremonies in Mesoamerica.",,,Neurología (English Edition),,Elsevier,2173-5808,,2015-01,2015,,2015-01,30,1,42-49,Closed,Article,"Carod-Artal, F.J.","Carod-Artal, F.J.

These materials often give rise to difficulties of definition, analysis and identification, and legislatures are often reluctant to control a wider range of natural products. Even cannabis and opium and the related product of poppy straw have caused problems in this respect. Until the advent of the United Kingdom Drugs Act 2005, fungi containing psilocin and psilocybin were not in themselves controlled; a prosecution needed to show that a preparation of such fungi had been produced. In the United Kingdom, the Home Office Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended that khat should not be controlled, but this advice was not accepted by the Government; since 2014 it has been a Class C controlled drug.

To identify these mushrooms, we attempted to prepare the monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactive to these hallucinogens. As an antigen inducing an anti-psilocin mAb, N-{4-[3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)indol-4-yl-oxy]butyl}succinamic acid was synthesized by modifying the 4-hydroxyl moiety of psilocin and coupled to a carrier protein of keyhole limpet hemocyanin. BALB/c mice were immunized five times with the antigen emulsified with an adjuvant, and their spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma cells. We obtained several hybridoma cells producing mAbs reactive to psilocin, from which four clones, BA631, CA231, KA422, and MA332 with a higher production of anti-psilocin mAb were selected by limiting dilution. Isotype of CA231 and KA422 mAbs were IgG2a and that of BA631 and MA332 mAbs were IgG1. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using BA631 mAb, revealed that BA631 cross-reacted with psilocin and dimethyltryptamine, but not with the other indole derivatives such as psilocybin, 4-hydroxyindole, tryptamine, and tryptophan.

They use many of their secondary metabolites to secure a place in a competitive natural environment and to protect themselves from predation. The diverse structures, biosyntheses and biological activities of fungal metabolites have attracted chemists for many years. Fungi are ubiquitous and their activities affect many aspects of our daily lives whether it be as sources of pharmaceuticals and food or as spoilage organisms and the causes of diseases in plants and man. The chemistry of the fungi involved in these activities has been the subject of considerable study particularly over the last fifty years. Although their ramifications can be large as in the spread of plant diseases, the quantities of the metabolites which could be isolated precluded much chemical work until the advent of spectroscopic methods. Whereas many natural products derived from plants were isolated prior to the 1960s on a scale which permitted extensive chemical degradation, this was rarely the case for fungal metabolites. This book is an introduction to the chemistry of fungal metabolites. The aim is to illustrate within the context of fungal metabolites, the historical progression from chemical to spectroscopic methods of structure elucidation, the development in biosynthetic studies from establishing sequences and mechanisms to chemical enzymology and genetics and the increasing understanding of the biological roles of natural products. The book begins with a historical introduction followed by a description of the general chemical features which contribute to the growth of fungi. There are many thousands of fungal metabolites whose structures are known and the book does not aim to list them all as there are databases to fulfill this role. The book's aim is to describe some of the more important metabolites classified according to their biosynthetic origin. Biosynthesis provides a unifying feature underlying the diverse structures of fungal metabolites and the chapters covering this area begin with a general outline of the relevant biosynthetic pathway before presenting a detailed description of particular metabolites. Investigations into these biosyntheses have utilized many subtle isotopic labelling experiments and compounds that are fungal pigments and those which are distinctive metabolites of the more conspicuous Basidiomycetes are treated separately. Many fungal metabolites are involved in the interactions of fungi with plants and others are toxic to man and some of these are described in further chapters. Fungi have the ability to transform chemicals in ways which can complement conventional reactions and the use of fungi as reagents forms the subject of the final chapter. This book will be particularly useful to anybody about to embark on a career in chemical microbiology by providing an overall perspective of fungal metabolites as well as an essential reference tool for more general chemists.",,,,The Chemistry of Fungi,Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC),,,24/06/2008,2008,24/06/2008,24/06/2008,,,165-176,Closed,Chapter,"Hanson, James R","Hanson, James R ()",,"Hanson, James R ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032993687,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

De nouveaux syndromes apparus durant la dernière décennie sont présentés : insuffisance rénale après consommation d'Amanita proxima d'apparition plus précoce que celle observée au cours du syndrome orellanien, érythermalgie avec Clitocybe amoenolens, rhabdomyolyse avec Tricholoma equestre, atteinte neurologique centrale avec Hapalopilus rutilans. Le diagnostic d'une intoxication par champignons repose sur une bonne connaissance des signes cliniques et de leurs délais d'apparition. Le pronostic est rarement défavorable sauf en cas d'ingestion d'espèces renfermant des amatoxines qui sont hépatotoxiques. Abstract Mushroom poisoning syndromes are described, with a presentation of the species, their toxins, symptoms and treatment. Some new mushroom poisoning syndromes that have appeared this last decade are described: acute renal failure of early onset with the Amanita proxima, erythermalgia with Clitocybe amoenolens, rhabdomyolysis with Tricholoma equestre and central nervous system impairment with the Hapalopilus rutilans. Diagnosis of mushroom poisoning necessitates a good knowledge of the clinical symptoms, especially the delay between mushroom ingestion and the first complaints. The prognosis is generally favourable, except in case of ingestion of species containing amatoxins which are hepatotoxic.","pour les documents photographiques, à Monsieur Augst Jean-Pierre, secrétaire de la Société mycologique de Strasbourg ; Siège : Centre social et culturel de Hautepierre, 27, boulevard Victor-Hugo, 67200 Strasbourg.

Cependant, plusieurs cas d’intoxications sont signalées chaque année en France avec parfois des complications graves [2–4]. Le but de notre étude était d’évaluer la consommation de ces substances hallucinogènes par des étudiants de la région Poitou-Charentes.MéthodeUn questionnaire a été envoyé par mail à 9 000 étudiants inscrits à l’université de Poitiers ou de La Rochelle afin de décrire les pratiques de consommation : le type de plantes et de champignons hallucinogènes consommés, la fréquence d’utilisation, les préparations, la voie d’administration, les effets recherchés, les effets secondaires…RésultatsParmi les 1 211 étudiants ayant répondu à l’enquête, 150 ont déjà consommé des produits hallucinogènes ; 41 % sont des femmes contre 59 % d’hommes. L’âge de la première consommation se situe entre 13 et 22 ans (21 % à 18 ans et 19 % à 17 ans). De plus, 54,5 % des étudiants consomment toujours actuellement dont 69 % de façon occasionnelle. Les substances utilisées sont principalement des champignons hallucinogènes (54 % ; psilocybes, amanites) et des plantes (37 % ; cannabis, sauge divinatoire, datura). Ces substances sont souvent consommées sous forme séchée (62 %) ou fraîche (22 %) et ingérées par voie orale (51 %) ou fumée (30 %), dans un contexte festif. Les consommateurs recherchent surtout l’euphorie, les hallucinations, la stimulation et la sérénité. Les effets indésirables rapportés sont des perturbations gastro-intestinales, des sensations de panique et un mal-être.DiscussionNos résultats ont montré que 12,4 % des étudiants ayant répondu à l’enquête, sont consommateurs de plantes ou de champignons hallucinogènes. Cette donnée est supérieure aux valeurs nationales de 2010 rapportant que 5 % des 15–30 ans ont déjà expérimenté ces substances et que 0,6 % sont des usagers actuels [5]. De plus, des données de Drogue Info Service obtenues par le CEIP de Paris permettent de compléter et de valider les résultats de notre étude. Ainsi, le nombre important de consommateurs, la facilité d’obtention de ces composés et la possibilité de complications graves montrent que la prévention contre les intoxications liées aux produits hallucinogènes naturels semble justifiée.",,,Therapies,,Elsevier,"0040-5957, 1958-5578",,2017-02,2017,,2017-02,72,1,147-148,Closed,Article,"Pain, Stéphanie; Batisse, Anne; Chevalier, Cécile; Ingrand, Isabelle; Chavant, François; Fauconneau, Bernard; Pérault-Pochat, Marie-Christine","Pain, Stéphanie (CEIP-A de Poitiers, service de pharmacologie clinique et vigilances, ancien pavillon administratif, CHU, rue de la Milétrie, BP 577, 86021 Poitiers cedex, France; Laboratoire de neurosciences expérimentales et cliniques, Inserm U1084, pôle biologie santé, Poitiers, France); Batisse, Anne (CEIP-A de Paris, hôpital Fernand-Widal, Paris, France); Chevalier, Cécile (CEIP-A de Paris, hôpital Fernand-Widal, Paris, France); Ingrand, Isabelle (CEIP-A de Poitiers, service de pharmacologie clinique et vigilances, ancien pavillon administratif, CHU, rue de la Milétrie, BP 577, 86021 Poitiers cedex, France); Chavant, François (CEIP-A de Poitiers, service de pharmacologie clinique et vigilances, ancien pavillon administratif, CHU, rue de la Milétrie, BP 577, 86021 Poitiers cedex, France); Fauconneau, Bernard (CEIP-A de Poitiers, service de pharmacologie clinique et vigilances, ancien pavillon administratif, CHU, rue de la Milétrie, BP 577, 86021 Poitiers cedex, France); Pérault-Pochat, Marie-Christine (CEIP-A de Poitiers, service de pharmacologie clinique et vigilances, ancien pavillon administratif, CHU, rue de la Milétrie, BP 577, 86021 Poitiers cedex, France; Laboratoire de neurosciences expérimentales et cliniques, Inserm U1084, pôle biologie santé, Poitiers, France)","Pain, Stéphanie (; Inserm)","Pain, Stéphanie (Inserm); Batisse, Anne (Hôpital Fernand-Widal); Chevalier, Cécile (Hôpital Fernand-Widal); Ingrand, Isabelle (); Chavant, François (); Fauconneau, Bernard (); Pérault-Pochat, Marie-Christine (Inserm)",Inserm; Hôpital Fernand-Widal,grid.7429.8; grid.414095.d,Paris; Paris,; ,France; France,,,,,,0,0,,0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084110736,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,,,,,,

L'hyperthermie est constamment associée aux intoxications graves par cocaïne et ecstasy et peut engendrer d'autres effets cliniques graves voire mortels. Le traitement de l'hyperthermie par les techniques physiques usuelles de refroidissement relève de l'extrême urgence et est une étape décisive dans la prévention de la mortalité. Le traitement de ces intoxications est, par ailleurs, principalement symptomatique. L'utilisation de la naloxone peut être une alternative pour éviter une intubation–ventilation en cas d'intoxications par les opiacés; son utilisation est néanmoins délicate et non recommandée en cas d'intoxication par la buprénorphine.AbstractSevere acute adverse effects may following ingestion of drugs such cocaine, opiates, ecstasy, gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), datura, psilocybe, ketamine.

Eating wild mushroom is dangerous because misidentification of toxic mushroom as magic mushroom may be fatal. Magic mushroom contains psilocybin and psilocin but major psychedelic action of magic mushroom is due to rapid conversion of psilocybin to psilocin after ingestion. Active ingredient of peyote cactus is mescaline. Abuse of LSD was widespread in 1960s but this drug is still abused today. Khat leaves are chewed in certain parts of Africa but with migration, this product is also abused in Europe and United States. Major active ingredient of khat plant is cathinone, which is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine. Volatile abuse is widespread among young people. Abusing volatiles containing toluene, hydrocarbons, and other compounds with highvapor pressure is injurious to health.

Most participants identified with the terms Rodnovera/Starovera in regards to naming their beliefs, or preferred to eschew labels. A variety of plants were used for both sacred and secular purposes, with eighty-four categories emerging when participants’ lists were combined. The most frequently mentioned were Cannabis spp., Hypericum perforatum, and Salvia spp., with the latter two also being the most commonly co-occurring plants on lists. The interviews and plants used display the integral role that plants play in the sacred ritual life of nature worship groups in Slovenia, and underline the importance of the symbolic nature of the plants, or the plant’s “spirit.” These characteristics were of greater importance than physical properties, showing the importance of symbolic relations in how the Pagan nature worshipers of Slovenia connect with their divine conceptions of nature.",,,Pomegranate The International Journal of Pagan Studies,,Equinox Publishing,"1528-0268, 1743-1735",,10/03/2021,2021,10/03/2021,,22,1,53–83,Closed,Article,"Fatur, Karsten","Fatur, Karsten ()",,"Fatur, Karsten ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136300979,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

Growth of the fungus in the epidermis and outer cortex was predominantly intracellular, whereas in the inner cortex the hyphae observed were mainly intercellular. Hyphae could not be detected in the stele 24 or 72 h after inoculation. Enzymatic activity in the apex of penetration hyphae is a possible explanation of the electron-dense areas seen in host cell walls 72 h after inoculation. Separation of plasmalemma from cell wall and degeneration of host nuclei and mitochondria were other infection-induced changes commonly seen. A host response to fungal infection involved the development of papillae between the plasma membrane and cell wall of the plant as well as around fungal hyphae.

Mushroom poisonings can be divided into non-life-threatening, early-onset poisonings—where symptoms appear within six hours of eating a mushroom—and life-threatening, late-onset poisonings—where symptoms appear over six hours after ingestion. The toxins in the early-onset group are muscarine from Inocybe spp. (fiber caps) and Clitocybe dealbata (the sweater), muscimol and ibotenic acid from Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) and Amanita pantherina (the panther), hallucinogens—especially psilocybin—from Psilocybe spp. (magic mushrooms), coprine from Coprinus atramentarius (alcohol inky cap), and a possible allergen from Paxillus involutus (poison pax). The toxins in the late-onset group are amatoxins from Amanita phalloides (death cap), Amanita verna (destroying angel), Amanita virosa, and some Galerina and Lepiota species; orellanine from Cortinarius orellanus (deadly Cortinarius); and gyromitrin from Gyromitra esculenta (false morel). The ingestion of mushrooms containing psilocybin produces hallucinogenic effects and has become a popular form of substance abuse among some adolescents and young adults.",,,Handbook of Analytical Separations,Forensic Science,Elsevier,1567-7192,,2008,2008,,2008,6,,391-399,Closed,Chapter,"Ojanperä, Ilkka","Ojanperä, Ilkka (Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, P.O.

Inputs to grassland soils are typically low in lignin, often comminuted and in the form of dung with below-ground inputs from roots being important. The several hundred basidiomycete species which are preferentially found in grassland can be placed into four functional groupings: litter decomposers, dung fungi, terricolous species and root endophytes. However, detection of these in the absence of basidiocarps has hampered their study, an exception being the fairy ring-forming species. It is clear that basidiomycetes contribute to lignocellulose degradation in grassland soil and litter, though it is likely that ascomycetes play a relatively greater part in this process than in woodland systems. Changes in agricultural management have led to the loss of many semi-natural grasslands in Europe and there are concerns abolit losses of several grassland taxa, such as Hygrocybe and Entoloma spp.",,,British Mycological Society Symposia Series,Ecology of Saprotrophic Basidiomycetes,Elsevier,0275-0287,,2008,2008,,2008,28,,277-299,Closed,Chapter,"Griffith, Gareth W.; Roderick, Kevin","Griffith, Gareth W.

In this respect, it has been observed that basidiomycetes collected at random (in season) and broken apart will sometimes reveal the presence of some leuco chemical that changes color upon oxidation by air. A simple example is that of some types of white latex in the genus lactarius (lacking in older and dry specimens). The chapter also discusses the importance of other chemotaxonomic aids in fleshy fungi, such as indolyl derivatives, urea, tetronic acids, terphenylquinones, styrylpyrones in gymnopilus and polyporus, and polyacetylenic compounds. Analyses of the more stable molecules revealed both allenic and acetylenic groups, ranging in length from eight to 10 carbons. So far, about 50 compounds have been characterized from species within 14 genera of basidiomycetes scattered among several different families. It is observed that none of these compounds has yet been isolated directly from the original carpophores from which the subcultures were obtained.",,,Advances in Applied Microbiology,,Elsevier,0065-2164,,1970,1970,,1970,13,,Jan-23,Closed,Chapter,"Benedict, Robert G.","Benedict, Robert G.

Im Erwachsenenalter überwiegen hierbei Intoxikationen mit Arzneimitteln. Eine subtile Anamnese sowie sorgfältige klinische Untersuchung sind die Grundlage der Diagnostik. Anhand des klinischen Erscheinungsbilds lassen sich typische Toxidrome abgrenzen. Als zusätzliche diagnostische Maßnahmen sind ein Drogenscreening im Urin sowie eine Blutalkoholbestimmung schnell und breit verfügbar. Als wichtigste therapeutische Maßnahme steht die Sicherung der Vitalparameter im Vordergrund. Der frühzeitige Kontakt mit einem Giftinformationszentrum ist für die Einschätzung der Gefährdung und das weitere Prozedere hilfreich.

Among these metabolites are the tryptamine-derived compounds psilocybin, its precursors, and natural derivatives (collectively referred to as psiloids), which have played significant roles in human society and culture. The high allocation of nitrogen to psiloids in mushrooms, along with evidence of convergent evolution and horizontal transfer of psilocybin genes, suggest they provide a selective benefit to some fungi. However, no precise ecological roles of psilocybin have been experimentally determined. The structural and functional similarities of psiloids to serotonin, an essential neurotransmitter in animals, suggest that they may enhance the fitness of fungi through interference with serotonergic processes. However, other ecological mechanisms of psiloids have been proposed. Here, we review the literature pertinent to psilocybin ecology and propose potential adaptive advantages psiloids may confer to fungi.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Meyer, Matthew; Slot, Jason","Meyer, Matthew (Ohio State University (OSU) - College of Food, Agricultural & Environmental Science); Slot, Jason (Ohio State University (OSU) - College of Food, Agricultural & Environmental Science)",,"Meyer, Matthew (); Slot, Jason ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156197391,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

The question of the beginning of the crystallization of human consciousness intrigues today’s researchers. American writer and ethnobotanist Terence McKenna tangled with such ideas, indeed one of his thoughts contributes to many controversial opinions and theories presented in this work. The stoned ape theory considers psilocybin, the active substance of entheogenic mushrooms, as an element that played an important role in the process of human evolution and contributed to the acceleration of human consciousness. The author of a title theory believes that psychoactive mushrooms, which might have been components of our ancestors’ diet, could also contributed to the development of language and religion.

The data gathered in the field were used to perform statistical analyses to investigate possible correlations between the sampling sites of fungal species and some environmental parameters.

Toutefois, les intoxications accidentelles par champignons restent rares. La majorité de ces champignons toxiques ne provoquent souvent qu’une gastroentérite isolée et modérée. Hormis les intoxications phalloïdiennes (Amanita phalloides) responsables de 90 % des décès, peu de champignons sont responsables de décès. La physiopathologie et les tableaux cliniques doivent être connus pour éviter les complications. D’une façon générale, plus le délai d’apparition des signes est court après l’ingestion, moins le champignon est toxique. En pratique, la différenciation entre les syndromes à incubation courte ou longue doit être nuancée. En effet, certains champignons responsables d’un syndrome muscarinien de courte latence (30minutes à deux heures) peuvent être mortels dans le cas d’ingestion massive et survenant chez un patient « fragilisé ». C’est le cas des inocybes. La prise en charge dès la phase préhospitalière est alors primordiale, car si la majorité des intoxications répond à un traitement symptomatique, les formes graves nécessitent des mesures de réanimation spécifiques et l’administration d’atropine à forte dose jusqu’à disparition de l’hypersécrétion. Nous rapportons le cas de deux syndromes muscariniques sévères par ingestion de champignons dont l’un fut d’évolution fatale.Many poisonous fungi exist in France. However, the accidental intoxications by mushrooms remain rare. The majority of these toxic mushrooms often cause only an isolated and moderated gastroenteritis. Except the intoxications phalloidines (Amanita phalloides), responsible for 90% of the deaths, few mushrooms are responsible for death. The clinical physiopathology and pictures must be known to avoid the complications. Mushroom poisoning is rare but sometimes very serious. The prognosis is dependent to the quantity ingested and the time taken for clinical signs to appear. Generally, more the time of appearance of the signs is short after ingestion, less the mushroom is toxic. In practice, differentiation between the syndromes with short or long incubation must be moderate. Indeed certain mushrooms responsible for a muscarinic syndrome of short latency (30min to 2 h) can be mortals in the case of ingestion massive and occurring at a “weakened” patient. It is the case of inocybes. The prehospital management is very important, because if the majority of the intoxications answers a symptomatic treatment, the serious forms require specific measurements: intravenous atropine with strong amount until disappearance of the hypersecretion.

Typical examples are the comparative investigations of confiscated addictive drugs to determine their origins or the investigation and classification of traces of paint after a traffic accident. In contrast it is the province of forensic toxicology, to give evidence concerning the effects of substances (poisons) on men and more rarely on animals in disputed court cases. Forensic toxicology for its part is a portion of forensic medicine alongside forensic pathology, morphology, psychiatry and serology.",,,Chemical Laboratory Practice,Practice of High Performance Liquid Chromatography,Springer Nature,0172-4967,,1986,1986,,1986,,,241-285,Closed,Chapter,"Daldrup, T.; Michalke, P.; Szathmary, S.","Daldrup, T.

Cocaine is the second most frequently used illicit drug in the United States after marijuana. Cocaine abuse is associated with chest pain, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, arrhythmias, and premature coronary atherosclerosis. Long-term alcohol abuse is also associated with cardiac systolic dysfunction, arrhythmias, and hypertension, but when consumed in moderation appears to confer cardiovascular health benefits. Abstinence can reverse many of these adverse effects. Opiates (particularly heroin abuse) are associated with arrhythmias and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Amphetamine use has been associated with MI and cardiomyopathy, while cardiotoxic effects resulting from chronic marijuana (or cannabis) use are relatively infrequent.

Phylogenetic analyses show it to be most closely related to Pachylepyrium carbonicola (A.H. Sm.) Singer and P. funariophilum (M.M. Moser) Singer (Strophariaceae). Investigation of additional species of Pachylepyrium suggests this genus is polyphyletic as the type species, P. fulvidula (Singer) Singer, is nested in the Tubariaceae Vizzini based on multigene phylogenetic analyses. Pachylepyrium nubicola Singer is allied with Pholiota (Fr.) P. Kumm. based on high ITS similarity, and P. carbonicola and P. funariophilum, together with G. clavus, form a clade among a consortium of Strophariaceae Singer & A.H. Sm. and Hymenogastraceae Vittad. As a result, we propose Romagnesiella gen. nov. to accommodate G. clavus, for which a taxonomic description is given and lectotype and epitype are designated. The genus Crassisporium gen. nov. is proposed to encompass Pachylepyrium funariophilum (of which P. carbonicola is considered a younger taxonomic synonym), P. chilense M.M. Moser, and P. squarrulosum Singer. Crassisporium is distinguished from Romagnesiella by its thick-walled basidiospores and occurrence in burnt habitats. The identities of the morphologically similar Tubaria umbonata S. Lundell, T. embolus (Fr.) Sacc. and T. minima J.E. Lange are also discussed.","The authors are grateful to staff at herbaria G (P.

1157,pub.1068139571,10.1615/intjmedmushr.v8.i3.70,,,,Poisonous and Hallucinogenic Mushrooms of India,"Mycetism or mycetismus (mushroom poisoning) is caused by toxins present in the basidiomata even after it is properly cooked. There are mainly seven different types of poisoning syndromes (Phalloides syndrome, Orellanus syndrome, Gyromitra syndrome, Muscarin syndrome, Pantherina syndrome, Psilocybin syndrome, and Gastrointestinal syndrome), along with Paxillus syndrome and coprine syndrome. The Indian subcontinent consists of several ecoclimatic zones and it is a treasure trove of fungal diversity. In fact, the Western Ghats, which form a long mountainous region along the west coast of India, is considered as one of the hot spots of biodiversity. The mushroom biota of this large country is still not explored fully and to date only about 1200 species of fungi belonging to the orders Agaricales, Russulales, and Boletales are described in comparison to about 14,000 species of mushrooms reported from all over the world. This represents only 10% of the world biota of mushrooms, and the majority of the other 90% remain to be discovered in the tropical regions of the world. The present review deals with the distribution of poisonous and hallucinogenic species of mushrooms described from India. A survey of the literature reveals the species of fungi belonging to various genera that are reported from India, which cause the major types of mushroom poisoning syndromes. Among the total number of mushrooms reported from India, only a very small percentage are poisonous or hallucinogenic. Even though there are several reports in the newspapers about poisoning after consumption of mushrooms, there is only one report of a clinically proven case of mushroom poisoning by Chlorophyllum molybdites in India. There is a need for greater awareness of mushroom poisoning among the general public and clinicians in India. The need of a database of poisonous mushrooms and the symptoms of mushroom poisoning along with the germ plasm collections is emphasized. There is a great need of chemical investigations of Indian mushrooms for their active principles, which can possibly be used in a wide range of metabolic and infectious diseases, such as cancer, AIDS, and others.",,,International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms,,Begell House,"1521-9437, 1940-4344",,2006,2006,,2006,8,3,251-262,Closed,Article,"Deshmukh, S.

Attempts to isolate the poisonous alkaloid of a fungus, the red fly agaric Amanita muscaria, were made almost 130 years ago. In 1869, Schmiedeberg and Koppe reported on an enriched preparation of muscarine which was regarded for a long time as the general toxin of all poisonous mushrooms. More than 20 years later, Kobert (1891, 1893), in his attempt to isolate the toxic component of poisonous Amanita mushrooms by precipitation from water with ethyl alcolhol, obtained a substance with strong hemolytic properties, named phallin. Later, Kobert (Raab 1932) reported on the existence of highly poisonous substances in the filtrate of phallin precipitation. At the same time, Ford (1909) in Baltimore (USA) after ten years work presented a toxic, ca. 10% enriched preparation of “amanitatoxin”.",,,The Mycota,Human and Animal Relationships,Springer Nature,,,1996,1996,,1996,,,229-248,Closed,Chapter,"Wieland, T.","Wieland, T.

1149,pub.1049619344,10.1007/s002530050752,,,,The ubiquity of natural adsorbable organic halogen production among basidiomycetes,"Abstract Recently, several species of basidiomycetes were shown to produce de novo high concentrations of chloroaromatic metabolites. Since these lignocellulose-degrading fungi play a major role in the ecosphere, the purpose of this study was to determine the ubiquity of organohalogen production among basidiomycetes. A total of 191 fungal strains were monitored for adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) production when grown on defined liquid media. Approximately 50% of the strains tested and 55% of the genera tested produced AOX. A low production of 0.1–0.5 mg AOX/l was observed among 25% of the strains, a moderate production of 0.5–5.0 mg AOX/l was observed among 16% of the strains and 9% of the strains produced high levels (5–67 mg AOX/l). The latter group was dominated by species belonging to the genera Hypholoma, Mycena and Bjerkandera, showing specific AOX productions in the range 1074–30893 mg AOX/kg dry weight of mycelial biomass. Many highly ecologically significant fungal species were identified among the moderate to high producers. These species were also able to produce AOX when cultivated on natural lignocellulosic substrates. Hypholoma fasciculare and Mycena metata respectively produced up to 132 mg and 193 mg AOX/kg dry weight of forest litter substrate in 6 weeks.",,,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Springer Nature,"0175-7598, 1432-0614",,1996-06,1996,,1996-06,45,5,710-718,Closed,Article,"Verhagen, F.

The data and methods needed for successful use of fungi in environmental conservation are mentioned. A survey is given of the main habitats of threatened fungi in Western and Central Europe, including data on the significance of their mycoflora, the causes of decrease and possible measures to improve the situation. The value of macrofungi as bio-indicators for environmental quality is discussed and demonstrated with three examples: the indicator value of wood-inhabiting fungi for undisturbed forest sites; of ectomycorrhizal fungi for air pollution stress in forests and of saprotrophic fungi for the duration of undisturbed grassland use. Lists of indicator species with different indicator values for air pollution stress and grassland use are provided.",,,Plant Biosystems - An International Journal Dealing with all Aspects of Plant Biology,,Taylor & Francis,"1126-3504, 1724-5575, 0017-0070",,1992-01,1992,,1992-01,126,6,779-795,Closed,Article,"Arnolds, Eef","Arnolds, Eef (Biological Station, Centre for Soil Ecology, Kampsweg 27, 9418 PD, Wijster, The Netherlands)",,"Arnolds, Eef ()",,,,,,,,,,,3,0,,,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029105353,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,15 Life on Land

1099,pub.1047573682,10.1159/000283645,,,,Medizin in (Latein)Amerika vor der Conquista. Teil I: Allgemeines und Andenregion,"Nachstehender ‘Essay’ soll dem Leser eine Idee Über die UrsprÜnge der Volksmedizin in (Latein)Amerika vermitteln. Amerika wurde durch die EuropÄer erobert und da, wo nicht genÜgend Einheimische die harte Arbeit und die eingeschleppten Epidemien Überlebten, mit Sklaven aus Schwarzafrika besiedelt. Die heutigen Volksglauben stellen einen Synkretismus aus althergebrachten GÖttern und dem europÄischem (katholischen) Christentum dar. Die ‘echte’ althergebrachte Volksmedizin in (Latein)Amerika ist heute kaum mehr anzutreffen. Das Wissen wurde durch direktes Training weiter gegeben, es gab keine schriftlichen Dokumente. Man ist deshalb auf Exkursionen zu den Hauptkulturzentren zur Zeit der Eroberung angewiesen. Die Zeit der Eroberung ist eine Periode der Globalisierung, auch was infektiÖse Krankheiten betrifft (Pocken, Masern, Cholera, usw.); gewisse Pflanzen gelangten nicht nur nach Europa sondern auch nach Afrika. Paleopathologische Studien zeigen, dass die Gesundheit der Einheimischen nicht besser als die der europÄischen Zeitgenossen war; die mittlere Lebenserwartung wird auf ca. 38-43 Jahre geschÄtzt. Wie am Beispiel der Andenkulturen gezeigt wird, trifft man einerseits auf eine interpretationsfreie Empirie, andrerseits auf animistische Vorstellungen der Krankheiten (bez. Andenregion z.T. beschrieben in den ‘Comentarios Reales’). Krankheiten entstehen als Folge eines Ungleichgewichts zwischen KÖrper, Geist(er) und GÖttern. Halluzinogene gehÖrten zum zentralen Armamentarium der Schamanenmedizin; grÖsste Bedeutung kam in den Andenregionen der Coca zu, nebst zahlreichen anderen Pflanzen. Die anthropomorphen ‘Huaco’ Vasen der Mochicas waren das Werk von Frauen und vermitteln auch die Gesundheitsvorstellungen und Erfahrungen derselben; die Thematik steht oft in scharfem Kontrast zu den patriarchalisch geprÄgten DenkmÄlern.",,,Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Ganzheitsmedizin / Swiss Journal of Integrative Medicine,,Karger Publishers,"1015-0684, 1663-7607",,01/01/2006,2006,09/02/2010,01/01/2006,19,1,48-55,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Brignoli, Reto; Saller, Reinhard","Brignoli, Reto (Facharzt f&uuml;r klinische Pharmakologie, CH-Rueschlikon, Universit&auml;tsSpital Z&uuml;rich, Dep. f&uuml;r Innere Medizin, Institut f&uuml;r Naturheilkunde, CH-Z&uuml;rich); Saller, Reinhard (Facharzt f&uuml;r klinische Pharmakologie, CH-Rueschlikon, Universit&auml;tsSpital Z&uuml;rich, Dep. f&uuml;r Innere Medizin, Institut f&uuml;r Naturheilkunde, CH-Z&uuml;rich)",,"Brignoli, Reto (); Saller, Reinhard ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/283645,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047573682,,,,,,,,

Es wird geschätzt, dass etwa die Hälfte der Partygänger zumindest gelegentlich Drogen einnimmt [17, 34].

Hallucinogens, which include naturally occurring compounds such as psilocybin and mescaline, as well as synthetic compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), induce profound alterations of human consciousness, emotion, cognition, and mood. The discovery of LSD and the observation that LSD and the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin share chemical and pharmacological profiles led to the suggestion that biogenic amines like serotonin were involved in the mechanism of action of hallucinogens as well as in psychotic mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Based on evidence from rodents and humans, the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor appears to be responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of tryptamine, ergoline, and phenethylamine hallucinogens. In this chapter, we review existing literature on the molecular and signaling mechanisms involved in the behavioral effects of hallucinogens.",We thank the National Institutes of Health for our molecular pharmacology research.,,,Neuropathology of Drug Addictions and Substance Misuse,Elsevier,,,2016,2016,,2016,,,803-812,Closed,Chapter,"Hanks, James B.; González-Maeso, Javier","Hanks, James B.

From the biological point of view, the alkaloid is any biologically active and heterocyclic chemical compound which contains nitrogen and may have some pharmacological activity and, in many cases, medicinal, or ecological use. They are a special group of chemicals that are active at different cellular levels of organisms. They take part in the biological processes of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Alkaloids are classified according to the amino acids that provide their nitrogen atom and part of their skeleton. Alkaloids are derived from L-lysine, L-ornithine, L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, L-histidine, L-phenylalanine, nicotinic acid, anthranilic acid, or acetate. The terpenoid, steroid, and purine alkaloids are also important. Alkaloids also occur in the animal kingdom. Differently from plants, the source of these molecules in an animal's body can be endogenous or exogenous. Alkaloids are molecules participating in both producer and consumer chains in nature.

Mushroom poisonings are relatively common but seldom severe. In most instances, mushroom poisonings are accidental: poisonous mushrooms are mixed with edible mushrooms by amateur collectors resulting in acute poisonings of varied severity. The diagnosis of mushroom poisonings is thus often uncertain. The management of patients is therefore all too often based on the severity of clinical symptoms, their delay of onset, and observed changes in laboratory parameters, for example increased liver enzymes. Even edible mushrooms may cause gastrointestinal disturbances when excessive amounts are ingested. Indeed, many species contain trehalose which may cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, particularly in those individuals who lack the gut enzyme trehalase. Symptoms typically occur 15 minutes to 2 hours after ingesting the mushrooms and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This gastrointestinal syndrome is usually self-limiting and only supportive therapy is required.

They are known as priceless resources for generating various important biomolecules which have commercial applications in medicine, the food industry, and bioanthropology, although at present less than 10% of the currently known mushrooms are responsible for these biomolecules. At this phase of globalization, when people are engaged with organic or fresh cultivated foodstuffs, a section of the population which depends on the nontimber forest products for their livelihood are often the victims of poisonous mushrooms which mimic their edible counterparts. Mushrooms are considered to be highly nutritious with enormous medicinal value. However, their bioprospection and commercial exploitation are very limited as compared to other life forms, which may be due to the limited information available on their nutritional and health effects, and genetic variability. Proteins and polysaccharides comprise the main components of their dry matter. Mushrooms being high in their fiber content, less fat content, widely dispersed in the meadows with both poisonous and non-poisonous nature have attracted both the researchers and the consumers to mushrooms research as a source of functional foods.",,,,New and Future Developments in Microbial Biotechnology and Bioengineering,Elsevier,,,2019,2019,,2019,,,01-Dec,Closed,Chapter,"Borthakur, Madhusmita; Joshi, S.R.","Borthakur, Madhusmita (Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology Bioinformatics, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong, Meghalaya, India); Joshi, S.R.

Opium, which contains morphine and related alkaloids, was well known as an analgesic to the ancients. Cocaine was found in coca leaves in 1860 and has been used in South America as a masticatory since early times. Cocaine and its salts are the oldest local anesthetics but their use is now entirely regulated because of their toxic and addictive properties. The chemical reactions of drugs and synthetic organic compounds in the body occur through oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or conjugation resulting in activation or inactivation. Chemistry has made it possible for psychoactive compounds from nature to be synthetically converted into more active and less toxic compounds, but some are now controlled by law.

The delimitation of species and infrageneric units hitherto has been based on morphological and, to some extent, ecological characters. In this study we have analyzed nuclear ribosomal LSU and ITS sequences to reveal infrageneric phylogeny and the phylogenetic placement of Galerina among the dark-spored agarics. Sequences from 36 northern hemisphere Galerina species and 19 other dark-spored taxa were analyzed, some of them obtained from EMBL/GenBank. Our results, received from Bayesian and distance methods, strongly suggest that Galerina is a polyphyletic genus. The LSU analysis shows that Galerina is composed of three or four separate monophyletic main groups. In addition, a few species cluster together with other dark-spored agarics. The same groups are recognized in the ITS tree and they correspond roughly to previously recognized subgenera or sections in Galerina. With high support our LSU analysis suggests that Gymnopilus is a monophyletic genus and that Gymnopilus and one of the Galerina lineages (“mycenopsis”) are sister groups. The analyses further indicate that the Galerina lineages, as well as the genus Gymnopilus, could be referred to a strongly emendated family Strophariaceae, which corresponds largely to the family as circumscribed by Kühner (1980). Our results affirm that morphological characters often are highly homoplastic in the agarics. At the present stage formal taxonomic consequences or nomenclatural changes are not proposed.","We thank the curators of the herbaria at the Botanical Museum, Copenhagen, the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, and the Rijksherbarium in Leiden for kindly providing material, and Ronald Petersen, Knoxville, for providing data from mating experiments.

Ciguatera and tetrodotoxic fish poisonings cause acute gastrointestinal symptoms followed by paresthesia and neurotoxic or paralytic symptoms. Scombroid fish poisoning produces histamine-like symptoms caused by bacterial decomposition. Shellfish poisoning causes diarrheal, neurotoxic, paralytic, and amnesic syndromes. Plant poisoning is usually accidental but is sometimes with suicidal intent or from medicinal or recreational drugs. Specific antidotes are available for belladonna alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, and cyanogenic agents. Ergot alkaloids and aflatoxins may contaminate food crops. Many mushrooms and toadstools are considered delicacies. Amatoxins in death cap mushrooms cause 90% of fatalities. Delayed gastrointestinal symptoms are followed by liver damage.

This demand was met with a quick response from commercial markets. One component of this trend was the opening of smart shops – venues selling legal and predominantly ‘natural’ products. In this article the demand and supply side as well as the applicable law and regulatory strategies concerning this new trend are explored. The issues discussed include the following: what are smart shops and what products do they offer; and what are the health and social risks involved in the use of these products? Following this, current Dutch policy strategy with regard to this new trend is described. The current approach is based on the interface between drug policy, public health, consumer protection and pharmaceutical policy. This approach is based on the outcome of a health and social risks assessment by the Working Party on Smart Shops (1998) which concluded that these shops and their products do not currently pose major health or social risks. Nevertheless, the emergence of this new trend was thought to require the development of a policy that is based on reliable information, innovative prevention attempts and close monitoring.

Many efforts have been focused on their extraction, isolation, separation and structural elucidation by means of different approaches based on methodologies already established since the 1960s. New methodologies in extraction and sample preparation from different matrices include environmentally friendly techniques such as ionic liquids or supercritical fluid extraction as well as the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers. Chromatography combined with spectroscopy is still the preferred analytical tool for alkaloid analysis, but recent improvements in mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance-based technologies have also been applied to areas of research such as toxicology, quality control, metabolic fingerprinting and metabolic profiling. This review is intended to provide a more general rather than an exhaustive overview on the new methods for terpenoid indole alkaloid analysis focusing on hyphenated high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry approaches.

In high-enough doses, these psychedelic or psychomimetic drugs can induce illusions, hallucinations, or delusions. The hallucinogenic state is characterized by heightened awareness of sensory input, a sense of a divided self, and feelings not experienced outside of dreams or religious experiences. Most hallucinogens are plant alkaloids and function as 5-HT2A receptor agonists. Hallucinogens can be divided into indolylalkylamines and phenylalkylamines. This chapter encompasses the history, synthesis, drug abuse patterns, pharmacology, metabolism, detection and analysis, and toxicological interpretation of classic hallucinogenic compounds, including phencyclidine (PCP), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, psilocybin, and ketamine. More recently, synthetic analogs have also emerged in the illicit drug market as novel psychoactive substances, including analogs of PCP, mescaline (2C and NBOMe types), and ketamine.

Despite the upsurge in the research activities elsewhere, these studies are still in their infancy in Nigeria, which is one of the world's leading oil producers. Lentinus squarrosulus Mont., a white-rot fungus, was tested for its ability to bioremediate a soil contaminated with 0.5–40% concentrations of engine oil over a period of 3 months. Results obtained revealed that in soils contaminated with engine oil and inoculated by L. squarrosulus, the amount of organic matter, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus increased, whereas the available potassium was reduced. A relatively high percentage degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) was observed in low concentrations of engine oil and a considerably lower percentage for the higher concentrations of engine oil. The metal concentration of Fe, Cu, Zn, and Ni increased with the increase of engine oil concentration up to 20%, followed by a decrease showing bio-accumulation by the white-rot fungus. The improvement of nutrient content values as well as the bioaccumulation of heavy metals at 20% engine oil concentration by L. squarrosulus is of importance for the mycoremediation of an engine-oil polluted soil.",,,International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms,,Begell House,"1521-9437, 1940-4344",,2005,2005,,2005,7,3,369,All OA; Bronze,Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,,https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/download/article/4c2a5e726fdb5b89/IJM 0703 (369).pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068139471,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Through a number of detailed surveys of the distribution of Hygrocybe spp. and of genera showing similar patterns of occurrence (e.g. Clavaria spp., Entoloma spp., Geoglossum spp.) a picture is gradually emerging of the more important ‘waxcap grassland’ sites, and of those species in greatest need of protection. Waxcap fungi are far from ideal experimental organisms which explains why so little has been published about their biology and ecology. They cannot be cultured on laboratory media and the correct conditions for inducing spores of most species to germinate have yet to be established. Nevertheless approaches such as isotope ratio mass spectrometry and the use of molecular biology techniques are beginning to provide an insight into the role played by these organisms in grassland ecosystems, and why they are so adversely affected by many agricultural practices. Current field experiments at various sites including Sourhope near Kelso will also permit investigations into waxcap ecology to be correlated with parallel studies of other members of the soil biota.",,,Plant Ecology & Diversity,,Taylor & Francis,"0374-6607, 1755-1668, 1359-4869",,2002-01,2002,22/04/2009,2002-01,54,1,Jul-22,All OA; Green,Article,"Griffith, Gareth W.; Easton, Gary L.; Jones, Andrew W.","Griffith, Gareth W.

Agriculture, in particular sheep farming, is the primary industry of such hill and upland areas, and its expansion over the last seven–eight centuries has resulted in the development of vast areas of sheep walk composed of indigenous Agrostis-Festuca, Nardus and Molinia dominant grassland. These indigenous grasslands or rough grazings presently constitute some 70% of the land within the hills and uplands (Newbould, 1985). Traditionally, indigenous hill grasslands have been lightly grazed by pure bred sheep. Over the last few decades, however, intensities of sheep farming have increased dramatically, due largely to improvements in grassland productivity from use of fertilizer and lime. These agricultural improvements have caused considerable concern amongst conservationists, particularly for the loss of indigenous flora and fauna of the hills and uplands (Sydes & Miller, 1988; Bardgett & Marsden, 1992; Bardgett, Marsden & Howard, 1995). Recent changes in UK agricultural policy have reflected these concerns and addressed others, such as the overproduction of meat. Consequent reductions in financial subsidies based on output, and the introduction of monetary incentives for hill farmers to manage their land in such a way as to preserve or improve the environment (for example, environmentally sensitive areas) are likely to result in an overall reduction in liming and the use of fertilizer, and hence of the intensity of sheep grazing on upland grasslands.",,,,Fungi and Environmental Change,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,,11/04/1996,1996,05/11/2011,11/04/1996,,,163-183,Closed,Chapter,"Bardgett, R.

Psychotomimetic drugs produce effects in normal, healthy subjects that resemble the symptoms of naturally occurring psychosis. Drugs that are psychotomimetic vary considerably in their chemical structure and pharmacological properties. Many other psychotomimetic compounds structurally related to amphetamine have been made, many illicitly. Large doses of belladonna alkaloids, such as atropine and hyoscine, can produce hallucinations, confusion, and amnesia, and the plants from which they are derived have been used for centuries for their effects. The peripheral effects of Ditran are similar to those of atropine but its actions on the central nervous system are stimulatory. It causes feelings of apprehension, disorientation in time and space, depersonalization, and sensory disturbances and hallucinations, followed by confusion, emotional disturbances, and paranoid feelings. The facts that mescaline is structurally related to amphetamine and that amphetamine, consumed in large doses and/or over prolonged periods, can induce a psychotic-like state in normal individuals point to a common mechanism of action for these two drugs.",,,,Introduction to Neuropharmacology,Elsevier,,,1989,1989,,1989,,,293-309,Closed,Chapter,"Bradley, Philip B.","Bradley, Philip B.

Various factors have been put forward, each of which may play some part in affecting individual drug using outcomes. Rounsaville (1982), for example, analysed the life records of approximately 400 opiate users and identified two antecedents to drug use, childhood trauma and early antisocial or delinquent behaviour. Social background and deprivation have also been noted as possible preceding factors. Parker et al (1987) found correlations between heroin use and unemployment, overcrowding and other indices of deprivation. Other perspectives on use, cited by Johns (1990), include availability and peer influence. Sub‐culture has also been suggested as an important context to use (Becker, 1963; Williams, 1989). The Third Triennial Report to Congress (Department of Health and Public Service, 1991) focused on individual ‘risks’, which were categorised as biological (genetic), psychological, behavioural (anti‐social and delinquent activies), demographic (such as gender or ethnic factors), and environmental (arising from family or peer group influence).

Basidiomata of only 15 genera of 153 agaric and bolete genera surveyed had sarcodimitic tissues. The family, the Xerulaceae, is recognized for these 15 lamellate, sarcodimitic genera along with 1 genus exhibiting modified tissues and 2 closely allied genera apparently lacking sarcodimitic tissues. It is hypothesized that they evolved convergently and then in parallel with members of the Tricholomataceae. Taxonomic difficulties arising from the apparent loss of the sarcodimitic tissues in evolutionarily advanced taxa within the Xerulaceae, such as Mycena and Xerula, are discussed. Antibiotics with an (E)-β-methoxyacrylate moiety (strobilurins, oudemansin), which are potentially useful against cancer, with one possible exception are found only in a number of genera with sarcodimitic or derived tissues currently assigned to the Xerulaceae.

Psathyrella hololanigera and P. tenera are reported as new to Europe and P. parva as new to the Nordic countries. A four-gene dataset on Psathyrellaceae were analyzed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Constraint analyses were performed to determine limits of /Psathyrella, and to evaluate whether the /Coprinellus, /cordisporus, and /gossypina clades could be regarded with confidence as monophyletic clades outside of the clade /Psathyrella. This was not unambiguously supported. Based on the phylogenetic results, Kauffmania is proposed as a monotypic genus for the species P. larga and Typhrasa for P. gossypina and the new described species T. nanispora. The genus Homophron is formally validated and three combinations are proposed: H. spadiceum, H. cernuum, and H. camptopodum. The genus Cystoagaricus Singer is emended and the following new combinations are proposed: C. hirtosquamulosus, C. squarrosiceps, C. olivaceogriseus, and C. silvestris. Neotypes have been selected for seven species described by Fries, and ITS sequence data for these were generated. The following new combinations are proposed: Coprinopsis canoceps, C. cineraria, C. melanthina, C. submicrospora, C. uliginicola, and Typhrasa gossypina.

Various types of samples such as hair, drugs, explosives, toxins, fingerprints, documents, gunshot residues, and inks can be analyzed and detected using chromatography. Chromatography is one of the cheapest techniques that provides accurate results. Also, it is easy to operate, making it one of the most adaptable and abundant technique as well. This chapter discusses about the classification of chromatography on the basis of three different criteria. The various disadvantages and advantages of one technique over the other and why is it used over the previous one have also been discussed.

Fungal kingdom produces a variety of secondary metabolites, including all important classes like terpenes, terpenoids, alkaloids, and sugar derivatives. Though many fungal-derived natural products are known today, the production potential of fungus is significantly low because the expression of gene and corresponding secondary metabolites are cryptic/very less under laboratory condition. Therefore, scientific community around the world is searching for a chemical method to synthesize the secondary metabolite in laboratory at higher yield. Moreover, total in vitro chemical synthesis does not always signify a cost-effective method for producing fungal-derived natural compound, particularly when synthesizing compounds with complex chemistry. However, this issue can be overcome by utilizing heterologous production of secondary metabolites. Current chapter describes in detail the variety of secondary metabolites produced, their synthesis strategies via chemical and heterologous mode, as well as their biological applications.","A.K.S. acknowledges the CSIR New Delhi for providing financial support in the form of Senior Research Fellowship.

In the fungal kingdom, macrofungi taxonomically belong to two phyla, the Basidiomycota (class Agaricomycetes) and Ascomycota (class Pezizomycetes). Macrofungi have been used in traditional Asian and European Medicines, and based on 90,000 known worldwide distributed mushroom species, are considered an important resource for modern clinical and pharmacological research. They are regarded as a source of high- and low-molecular-weight bioactive compounds (alkaloids, lipids, phenolics, polysaccharides, proteins, steroids, terpenoids, etc.) with more than 130 therapeutic effects (anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, cytotoxic, hepatoprotective, hypocholesterolemic, hypoglycemic, hypotensive, immunomodulatory, etc.). There is also scientific evidence of using macrofungi as neuroprotectants, that is, Agaricus blazei (= Agaricus subrufescens), Ganoderma lucidum, Grifola frondosa, Hericium erinaceus, Pleurotus ostreatus, and Trametes versicolor. However, their neuroprotective effects have not been fully explored. This review discusses recent advances in research on the neuroprotective potential of macrofungi and perspectives for their application as neuroprotectants in biomedicine to prevent, support, or cure neurodegenerative disorders.","This review arises from a long-standing collaboration between two authors (S.M.B. and S.R.) on research directed to the identification of bioactive compounds from mushrooms and develops their medicinal properties.

In discussing harmful results it should be noted that harm can ensue from misuse of a drug which affects the mind, although dependence on the preparation may not have developed. Misuse is here viewed as the non-medical use of a drug for its seemingly pleasant mental effects. Unintentioned damage can arise from casual, even single misuse, e.g. infection following non-sterile injection or accidental injury while intoxicated. There are many substances whose effects on the brain and mind can lead to misuse and dependence, but they can be grouped into a relatively small number of categories.",,,,Substance Abuse and Dependence,Springer Nature,,,1990,1990,,1990,,,30-52,Closed,Chapter,"Madden, Spencer","Madden, Spencer ()",,"Madden, Spencer ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049786446,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Prescription Drug Abuse; Substance Misuse,Mental health,,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",3 Good Health and Well Being

A distinctive culture of protest emerged, particularly in response to the construction of new roads, with its own radicalised spirituality known as ''eco-paganism.'' One feature of the movement was the adoption of a fairy mythology as a significant belief narrative. This article gives examples of this mythology, showing how it was expressed, and demonstrates that it produced three responses: outright rejection; a symbolic identification with fairies; and/or literal belief. This last position was given credence by occasional phenomenological encounters with otherworldly beings, examples of which are given. The article concludes that, whether literal or symbolic, the belief in fairies helped protesters make sense of their struggles, hardships and occasional successes.",,,Folklore,,Taylor & Francis,"0015-587X, 1469-8315",,2001-01,2001,02/12/2010,2001-01,112,2,147-161,Closed,Article,"Letcher, Andy","Letcher, Andy ()",,"Letcher, Andy ()",,,,,,,,,,,18,2,,8.23,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026172393,44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology,,,,,,D31 Theology and Religious Studies,

The myth of beneficent nature is resistant to the accumulated evidence of health problems resulting from unknown or underestimated toxicity as well as from adulteration and misidentification of medicinal herbs [2]. Many plants contain substances toxic to humans and therefore, not surprisingly, to the human kidney. In early 1993, a rapidly progressive kidney fail ure leading to end-stage renal disease was reported in a number of women who had ingested slimming pills that contained powdered Chinese herbs [3]. Further investigations showed that this so called “Chinese herb nephropathy” was, in fact, secondary to the replacement of one of the prescribed Chinese herb, Stephania tetrandra, by other mixtures of Chinese herbs containing Aristolochia Fang chi [4]. The term “Aristolochia nephropathy” was thus proposed to be used instead of “Chinese herb nephropathy (CHN)” [5]. Finally, due to the presence of aristolochic acids (AA) in Aristolochia spp. and to their further demonstrated nephrotoxicity (see below), the term of “Aristolochic acid nephropathy” (AAN) is now commonly used.",,,,Clinical Nephrotoxins,Springer Nature,,,2008,2008,,2008,,,757-769,Closed,Chapter,"Debelle, Frédéric; Muniz-Martinez, Marie-Carmen; Vanherweghem, Jean-Louis; Nortier, Joëlle","Debelle, Frédéric (Nephrology Department, Erasme Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium); Muniz-Martinez, Marie-Carmen (Nephrology Department, Erasme Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium); Vanherweghem, Jean-Louis (Nephrology Department, Erasme Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium); Nortier, Joëlle (Nephrology Department, Erasme Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium)",,"Debelle, Frédéric (Erasmus Hospital; Université Libre de Bruxelles); Muniz-Martinez, Marie-Carmen (Erasmus Hospital; Université Libre de Bruxelles); Vanherweghem, Jean-Louis (Erasmus Hospital; Université Libre de Bruxelles); Nortier, Joëlle (Erasmus Hospital; Université Libre de Bruxelles)",Erasmus Hospital; Université Libre de Bruxelles,grid.412157.4; grid.4989.c,Brussels; Brussels,; ,Belgium; Belgium,,,,,,1,0,,0.07,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025475851,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,Complementary and Integrative Health; Kidney Disease,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

Morphological aspects of development,"Fruiting body formation in Agaricomycetes (Agaricomycotina) represents the most complex developmental processes known in the fungal kingdom. Shapes range from simple resupinate forms with open hymenia through to closed puff-balls and false truffles with internally hidden hymenia and include brackets and stiped mushrooms, which may have open caps throughout or which open during development, where the hymenia cover the surfaces of gills or pores. Mushroom shapes and features do not necessarily reflect close or distant phylogenetic relationships. Thus, morphological characteristics have lost some of their former significance in taxonomy. The onset and progress of courses of processes in mushroom formation are determined by the sum of various genetic, physiological and environmental factors. Shapes of mushrooms can be dramatically changed by mutations and by adverse environmental conditions. Events in normal fruiting body formation may run in parallel or behind each other in the form of ‘subroutines’ that have different degrees of independency to each other. Alterations in details or in places and orders of distinct subroutines and omissions can result in abnormal mushrooms. Developmental processes, time courses and tissue structures have been described in more details for a few model species (such as the hemiangiocarpous Coprinopsis cinerea and the gymnocarpous Schizophyllum commune) and some species of commercial interest (e.g. the gymnocarpous Auricularia auricula-judae and the hemiangiocarpous Agaricus bisporus). Morphological descriptions of fruiting body development in these four species are summarized here. Agaricomycetes have relatively large genomes with more than 10,000 different genes, many of which are expressed during the fruiting process in specific pseudoparenchymatous tissues (plectenchyma) or possibly only in individual cells within a tissue and at specific times. To understand the distinct functions of all these genes in space and time will require very fine dissection and analysis of distinct mushroom tissues and cells in future studies.","This paper has been dedicated to Prof. Karl Esser on the occasion of his 90th birthday.

They are very diverse chemicals and biomolecules, but they are all secondary compounds and are derived from amino acids or from the transamination process. Alkaloids are classified according to the amino acids that provide their nitrogen atom and part of their skeleton. Similar alkaloids can have quite different biosynthetic pathways and different bioimpacts. Alkaloids are derived from l-lysine, l-ornithine, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, l-histidine, l-phenylalanine, nicotinic acid, anthranilic acid, acetate, or amination and transamination reactions. The terpenoid, steroid, and purine alkaloids are also important. Millions of people around the globe use purine alkaloids every day whether starting the day with a cup of coffee or drinking a cup of tea in the afternoon. Alkaloids also occur in the animal kingdom. Unlike plants, the source of these molecules in an animal’s body can be endogenous or exogenous. Alkaloids are molecules participating in both producer and consumer chains in nature. They are vital in feeding and enjoy activation, aggression, and defense of various species.

Depression in bipolar disorder is associated with significant morbidity and has few effective treatments. However, there is little available scientific data on the risk of psilocybin use in people with bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder have been excluded from modern clinical trials, out of understandable concerns of activating mania or worsening the illness course. As psilocybin becomes more available, people with these disorders will likely seek psilocybin treatment for depression and have likely already been doing so in unregulated settings. Our goal here is to summarize the known risks of psilocybin use (and similar substances) in bipolar disorder and to systematically evaluate examples of published case history data, in order to critically evaluate the relative risk of psilocybin as a treatment for bipolar depression. We found 17 cases suggesting that there is potential risk for activating a manic episode, thereby warranting caution. Nonetheless, the relative lack of systematic data or common case examples indicating risk appears to show that a cautious trial, using modern trial methods focusing on appropriate ‘set’ and ‘setting’, targeted at those lowest at risk for mania in the bipolar spectrum (e.g., bipolar 2 disorder), is very much needed, especially given the degree to which depression impacts this population.",,"Sources of direct funding, support, or sponsorship Dr. Woolley is funded in part via VA CSR&D 1IK4CX002090-01.

Three experiments were conducted to test the ability of culturable saprotrophic fungal isolates to utilise a range of artificial and more natural substrates that occur in organic matter, with the aims of (1) characterising the functional potential of ‘common’ and ‘occasional’ taxa in an upland grassland soil and (2) determining whether there was a high degree of apparent functional redundancy in these communities. ‘Function’ was defined as the ability of a fungal isolate to utilise broad categories of substrates (e.g. sugars, cellulose, lignin) that occur in organic matter and which change in proportion during decomposition. The terms ‘common/abundant/frequent’ and ‘occasional/infrequent’ usually referred here to the frequencies of occurrence of taxa estimated using Warcup soil plates. Accepting the difficulties of sampling fungi in soil, this appeared to be the most useful isolation method to produce a general picture of the microfungal community with an estimate of frequency of occurrence for every taxon obtained, and to provide cultures for use in function tests. The influence of this technique on the interpretation of the results is discussed.Forty-eight fungal isolates, obtained from an upland grassland in Roxburghshire, UK, were selected to cover the most ‘abundant’ taxa and a range of ‘occasionals’. Pure cultures of anamorphic fungi and members of the Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were tested. Although there was apparently a high degree of functional redundancy (equivalence) in assemblages of culturable decomposer fungi, with ‘frequent’ and ‘infrequent’ taxa largely utilising the same substrates, the ‘infrequent’ taxa played important roles in decomposition. ‘Infrequent’ microfungi tested were potentially more active in decomposition than the ‘frequent’ taxa, i.e. several had a higher overall activity, were able to utilise a wider range of substrates and were more combative than the ‘abundant’ taxa. When ‘abundant’ and ‘occasional’ taxa from the same putative guild were inoculated together on grass litter, there was slight evidence of ‘positive’ indirect effects on decomposition and cellulose degradation. Some ‘negative’ effects on lignin degradation, probably as a result of combat, were observed.It is possible that the ‘occasional’ taxa increased the temporal resilience of the ecosystem process of decomposition, and were ‘waiting in the wings’ to replace the abundant taxa. Nevertheless, greater functional diversity could be associated with the uncultured taxa not studied here.","We thank the Natural Environment Research Council&#x27;s Soil Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function thematic programme for funding this work, Biodiversity of grassland saprotrophic fungi in relation to their function.

As osmotrophs, they acquire nutrients in soluble form and can dissolve natural polymers. Plant material supplies the carbon requirements of most fungi, and species phylogeny is strongly associated with the evolution of an enzyme repertoire suited to saprotrophic, mutualistic or parasitic modes of nutrition. Scores of secreted enzymes depolymerise cellulose and hemicellulose, and solubilise lignin. Soluble nutrients are scavenged efficiently by multiple induced and constitutive membrane transport systems varying in substrate affinity. Secondary metabolites include bioactive molecules that mediate biotic interactions and are exploited in biotechnology. The fungal cell senses and responds to many of the same stimuli as animal cells. Global transcription factors regulate pathways of assimilation, metabolism and development. The foraging activities of soil fungi result in plant litter decomposition and mineral cycling, thus helping to maintain soil fertility and playing a central role in biogeochemistry.",,,,The Fungi,Elsevier,,,2016,2016,,2016,,J.

Traces highly suggestive of fermented beverages and remains of psychoactive plants have been recovered from archaeological sites throughout prehistoric Europe. This paper surveys the history of these substances from a cultural approach based on the contexts of consumption. A wide range of documents will be examined here (macrofossil remains of psychoactive plants, residues of fermented beverages, alkaloids in archaeological items and artistic depictions, among others). Considering that these sensory-altering products are mainly found in tombs and ceremonial places, they seem to be strongly connected to ritual usages. Far from being consumed for hedonistic purposes, it can therefore be argued that drug plants and alcoholic drinks had a sacred role among prehistoric societies.",,,Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory,,Springer Nature,"1072-5369, 1573-7764",,20/03/2014,2014,20/03/2014,2015-09,22,3,751-782,Closed,Article,"Guerra-Doce, Elisa","Guerra-Doce, Elisa (Departamento de Prehistoria, Universidad de Valladolid, Plaza del Campus s/n, 47011, Valladolid, Spain)","Guerra-Doce, Elisa (University of Valladolid)","Guerra-Doce, Elisa (University of Valladolid)",University of Valladolid,grid.5239.d,Valladolid,Castilla y León,Spain,,,,,,49,17,,31,105,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032071678,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",Substance Misuse,,,,,C15 Archaeology,

Monoamine neurotransmitters affect a remarkably wide range of functions in both the peripheral and central nervous systems, though the specific effects they have on brain function, and thus on behavior, can sometimes be difficult to define because these neurotransmitters most often modulate synaptic transmission by acting on metabotropic receptors.

In the United Kingdom almost a fifth of young people used illegal drugs between 2011 and 2012. As a group, recreational drugs account for a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among the young, and this is frequently via cardiovascular complications. This chapter profiles the cardiovascular properties of major recreational drugs in use at present, including cocaine, amphetamine-like compounds (e.g., MDMA), heroin, cannabis, LSD, inhaled volatile substances, and the scant information that exists on newer “designer drugs” and “legal highs.” Treatment for cardiovascular complications is also covered with up-to-date guidance. Cocaine’s cardiovascular risk profile is perhaps the most studied and its propensity to precipitate myocardial infarction in young, healthy adults is well known. However, it exerts its effects via a complex interplay of systems, an understanding of which is vital to guide management of the patient presenting with a cocaine-induced cardiovascular emergency. The risks of “body packing” and polydrug abuse are also covered.",,,,Heart and Toxins,Elsevier,,,2015,2015,,2015,,,459-491,Closed,Chapter,"Francis, Rohin; Ghuran, Azad","Francis, Rohin (Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals, NHS Trust, Queens Hospital, Romford, United Kingdom University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom); Ghuran, Azad (East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, Lister Hospital, Stevenage, United Kingdom)",,"Francis, Rohin (); Ghuran, Azad (Lister Hospital)",Lister Hospital,grid.415953.f,Stevenage,,United Kingdom,,,,,,0,0,,0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015884914,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Heart Disease; Patient Safety; Substance Misuse,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being

The last decade of the 20th century was a period in which the Czech drug scene underwent a radical transformation, both in problem drug use (see the definition in the editorial) and recreational use of illicit drugs. The original “hard core” groups were usually comprised of individuals who shared close personal relationships. A system of home production and self-supply dominated the market, and this system was not very organized or hierarchical. The entire drug scene opened up in the course of the 1990s and started to “move” and communicate markedly, both internally and externally. A stabilization of prices, purity, and availability of drugs, as well as the relationships and rules of the black market, was characteristic of the second half of the 1990s. The field of recreational use (of cannabis and the so-called “recreational” drugs in particular) went through a different development during this period, when other changes that deepened the commercial nature of the market took place.",,,Journal of Drug Issues,,SAGE Publications,"0022-0426, 1945-1369",,2007-01,2007,03/08/2016,2007-01,37,1,73-102,Closed,Article,"Miovský, Michal","Miovský, Michal ()",,"Miovský, Michal ()",,,,,,,,,,,12,3,,3.53,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042643459,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Substance Misuse,,,,,C20 Social Work and Social Policy,

Cannabis has been associated with cerebrovascular disease. The dysrhythmogenic properties of cannabis appear to be influenced by the effects of tetracannabinol on action potential shortening and on vagal tone hyperstimulation. Cannabis use is associated with impaired memory and learning, and cannabinoid neuroreceptors are present in especially high density in the hippocampus, which has a role in forming episodic memories or new associations. The cardiovascular toxicity of cocaine has been reviewed, providing an explanation of its ischemic and prothrombotic effects, accelerated coronary atherosclerosis, coronary vasoconstriction,and dysrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia or bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, prolongation of the QT interval, and torsade de pointes.",,,Side Effects of Drugs Annual,Side Effects of Drugs Annual 32 - A worldwide yearly survey of new data and trends in adverse drug reactions and interactions,Elsevier,"0378-6080, 2213-7432",,2010,2010,,2010,32,,55-74,Closed,Chapter,"Patel, Jayendra K.; Langenfeld, Sarah; Wong, Eileen","Patel, Jayendra K.

Here we assemble the 200-year (1819–2019) record of their discovery in North America, beginning with early Arctic sailing expeditions, followed by intense taxonomic studies, and concluding with the molecular era, all of which highlight the difficulty of exhaustively revealing their biodiversity in these extreme, cold-dominated habitats. Compiled biogeographic data reveal that a majority of arctic fungi have large intercontinental distributions with disjunct alpine populations.

In this chapter the word mushroom is used as referring to that part of fungi whose size is sufficient for them to be recognized without help of lens. Mushrooms found to be source of alkaloids occupy only a small taxonomic range. The species for which a particular alkaloid structure is characteristic are closely related and is comprised within the next higher taxon, genus, or family. The fungi world is a rich but only partly explored source of nitrogen-containing metabolities of various structures.

Stemming from the international drug control treaties, a central principle is that harmful properties need to be demonstrated before a substance can be scheduled. Yet for many of these substances, little is known about their pharmacology and toxicology. Furthermore, reliable population surveys and information on prevalence may not become available until a substance is well-established. While not requiring extensive resources, the basic properties of new substances could be investigated, but governments often wish to act before use becomes widespread. The existing systems of drug legislation are discussed, some of which (i.e. generic definitions and analogue control) originated in an earlier period of concern about ‘designer drugs’. There is a common view in many countries that existing drug law is inadequate and that new solutions must be found.

                  5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (acronymized as 5-MeO-DMT) is
                  sui generis
                  among the numerous naturally-occurring psychoactive substances due to its unparalleled ego-dissolving effects which can culminate in a state of nondual consciousness (which is phenomenologically similar to transformative peak experiences described in various ancient contemplative traditions, e.g., Advaita Vedānta, Mahāyāna Buddhism). The enigmatic molecule is endogenous to the human brain and has profound psychological effects which are hitherto only very poorly understood due to the absence of scientifically controlled human experimental trials. Its exact neuronal receptor binding profile is a matter of ongoing scientific research, however, its remarkable psychoactivity is presumably mediated via agonism of the 5-HT
                  2A
                  (serotonin) receptor subtype. Anthropological/ethnopharmacological evidence indicates that various cultures utilized 5-MeO-DMT containing plants for medicinal, psychological, and spiritual purposes for millennia. In this paper we argue that this naturally occurring serotonergic compound could be fruitfully utilized as a neurochemical research tool which has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the cognitive and neuronal processes which underpin cognition and creativity (downregulation of the default-mode network, increased neuronal functional connectivity, etc.). An eclectic interdisciplinary perspective is adopted, and we present converging evidence from a plurality of sources in support of this conjecture. Specifically, we suggest that 5-MeO-DMT has great potential in this respect due to its incommensurable capacity to completely disintegrate self-referential cognitive/neuronal processes (viz., “ego death”). The importance of unbiased systematic scientific research on naturally occurring endogenous psychoactive compounds is discussed from a Jamesian radical empiricism perspective and potential scenarios of abuse are discussed (particularly in the context of military torture).",,,bioRxiv,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,16/03/2019,2019,16/03/2019,,,,578435,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Germann, Christopher B.","Germann, Christopher B.

Misuse of drugs throughout or in later pregnancy may also impact on fetal well-being, and in some cases confer a risk of potentially serious effects in the neonate, such as neonatal withdrawal. Data demonstrating the extensive and lifelong problems associated with in utero exposure to alcohol are now vast and have been fundamental in informing the development of programs to reduce maternal alcohol use in pregnancy, and to improve diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in exposed individuals to enable early assessment and intervention. Unfortunately, the full fetal effects of drugs such as cannabis, opiates, amphetamines, cocaine and hallucinogens remain to be determined and use in pregnancy is therefore not advisable.

They carry a mixed population of microorganisms derived from the natural micro flora of sources. Microorganisms contaminate the food from harvesting to preparation to consumption. A food micro flora mainly depends on microbial type, characteristics of a food type, contamination, and processing and storage conditions. The microbial groups associated with foods are bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses. Microbial genetics has important applications in molecular and cell biology, medicine, agriculture, and the food and pharmaceutical industries. Certain types of fungi, mainly molds, produce organic acids, antibiotics, enzymes, and hormones. Not all fungi are beneficial and some damage agricultural crops, cause disease in animals and humans, and produce poisonous toxins in foods. The nature, level, and types of microorganisms in foods have an important role in public health, storage life of foods, and the type of spoilage.",,,,Food Microbiology: Principles into Practice,Wiley,,,22/04/2016,2016,22/04/2016,16/05/2016,,,35-80,Closed,Chapter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,,0.11,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044273210,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology",,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",2 Zero Hunger

The present work provides an overview of all validly published, currently used basidiomycete genera to date in a single document. An outline of all genera of Basidiomycota is provided, which includes 1928 currently used genera names, with 1263 synonyms, which are distributed in 241 families, 68 orders, 18 classes and four subphyla. We provide brief notes for each accepted genus including information on classification, number of accepted species, type species, life mode, habitat, distribution, and sequence information. Furthermore, three phylogenetic analyses with combined LSU, SSU, 5.8s, rpb1, rpb2, and ef1 datasets for the subphyla Agaricomycotina, Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina are conducted, respectively. Divergence time estimates are provided to the family level with 632 species from 62 orders, 168 families and 605 genera. Our study indicates that the divergence times of the subphyla in Basidiomycota are 406–430 Mya, classes are 211–383 Mya, and orders are 99–323 Mya, which are largely consistent with previous studies. In this study, all phylogenetically supported families were dated, with the families of Agaricomycotina diverging from 27–178 Mya, Pucciniomycotina from 85–222 Mya, and Ustilaginomycotina from 79–177 Mya. Divergence times as additional criterion in ranking provide additional evidence to resolve taxonomic problems in the Basidiomycota taxonomic system, and also provide a better understanding of their
phylogeny and evolution.","Rui-Lin Zhao thanks National Key R&amp;D Program of China (Project No. 2018YFD0400200), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project IDs: 31470152, 31360014 and 31970010) and Beijing Innovative Consortium of Agriculture Research System (Project ID:BAIC05-2019).

Mycotoxins have immunosuppressive effects; but some of them can cause cancers, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity, liver and kidney damage, birth defects, DNA damage and respiratory disorders. The problem of mycotoxins is long-lasting and their direct or indirect exposures to humans and animals must be further discussed. The first chapter will cover the historical perspective of mycotoxins along with timeline while the second one will provide overview including classification of mycotoxins and mycotoxicoses. The comprehensive information/ literature on traditional, emerging and mushroom mycotoxins will be given in chapters 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Chapter 6 will deal with mycotoxins co-occurrence poisoning whereas new and masked mycotoxins will be described in chapter 7. The important aspects of mycotoxin studies like extraction, characterization and analysis and management strategies will be summarized in 8 and 9 chapters. The last chapter of the book will cover the recent developments in toxicokinetic studies of mycotoxins.

Toxins are non‐replicating substances of biological origin, they are non‐infectious, non‐contagious, and non‐curable by antibiotics or chemotherapeutic agents. Toxins vary from very simple molecules, such as formic acid secreted by ants, to the multimillion‐Dalton protein toxins produced by several bacteria. Although most plant toxins are used for defense, animal toxins can be used for defense or to attack other animals, or for both roles. Toxins may be classified as either exotoxins, which are excreted by an organism, or endotoxins, which are released mainly when bacteria are lysed. Biotoxins are classified as seven major groups: bacterial toxins, mycotoxins, phytotoxins, insect poisons (bees), reptile poisons (snakes), amphibian toxins (frogs), and marine toxins (fish). The basic groups of natural toxins, their origin, mechanisms of action, and effects and treatments of their toxicity are discussed in this chapter.",,,,Mammalian Toxicology,Wiley,,,27/02/2015,2015,27/03/2015,27/02/2015,,,605-640,Closed,Chapter,"El‐Masry, Eman M.; Abou‐Donia, Mohamed B.","El‐Masry, Eman M.

The enigmatic molecule is endogenous to the human brain and has profound psychological effects which are hitherto only very poorly understood due to the absence of scientifically controlled human experimental trials. Its exact neuronal receptor binding profile is a matter of ongoing research; however, empirical evidence indicates that its remarkable psychoactivity is partially mediated via agonism of the 5-HT1A/2A (serotonin) receptor subtypes. Anthropological/ethnopharmacological evidence indicates that various cultures utilized 5-MeO-DMT containing plants for medicinal, psychological, and spiritual purposes for millennia. We propose that this naturally occurring serotonergic compound could be fruitfully utilized as a neurochemical research tool with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the psychological and neuronal processes which underpin cognition and creativity (e.g., downregulation of the default mode network, increased global functional connectivity, neuroplasticity, σ1 receptor interactions, etc.). An eclectic interdisciplinary perspective is adopted, and we present converging evidence from a plurality of sources in support of our conjecture. Specifically, we argue that 5-MeO-DMT has significant neuropsychopharmacological potential due to its incommensurable capacity to completely disintegrate self-referential cognitive/neuronal processes (viz., ego death).

The purpose of the Compendium is to assist risk assessors responsible for the evaluation of specific ingredients in food supplements, in more easily identifying the compound(s) of concern on which to focus the assessment. The Scientific Committee worked on a second version of that Compendium between January 2010 and February 2012, considering botanicals that appear on a negative list or subject to restricted use (e.g. max. level or certain parts allowed only) in at least one European Member State. Two annexes have been added compared to the first version; the first one lists botanicals for which not enough information on possible substances of concern could be found, or for which the information present could not be verified. The second one lists botanicals for which, although some data were available, the Scientific Committee could not identify substances of concern, or other reasons for the inclusion in the compendium. This new “Compendium of botanicals reported to contain naturally occuring substances of possible concern for human health” replaces the first version published in 2009; it lists in alphabetical order botanicals without any judgment on whether they are suitable or not suitable for food applications in Europe; it has no legal or regulatory force pertaining to the legal classification of products or substances.",,,EFSA Journal,,Wiley,1831-4732,,31/05/2012,2012,31/05/2012,2012-05,10,5,2663,All OA; Gold,Article,"Authority, European Food Safety","Authority, European Food Safety ()",,"Authority, European Food Safety ()",,,,,,,,,,,173,71,,16.36,25,https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2663,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036776765,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",Nutrition,,,,,C18 Law,

Terpenes and terpenoids are naturally occurring hydrocarbons, and ~2000 plant species of 60 families produce more than 55,000 terpenes and their derivatives. Terpenes are built from isoprene monomer (C5H8), and (C5H8)n. is the basic molecular formula. The oxygen-containing terpenes are called terpenoids or isoprenoids while steroids are cyclic terpenoids, and sterols are steroid alcohols. Terpenoids have significant importance in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry. Terpenoids contribute to plant essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, thyme, and mint), flavors (cinnamon, cloves, and ginger), color (yellow—sunflowers, red—tomatoes), etc. They protect plant against predators and pests (e.g., from herbivores, insects, fungi, microorganisms, etc.), aid to pollination and dispersal of spores, and in living organisms function range from pigments and fragrances to vitamins and precursors of sex hormones. Plant sterols, including campesterol, inhibit the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines and thereby reduce LDLs or cholesterol level. Phenols or phenolics are a class of chemical compounds with a benzene nucleus supporting a hydroxyl group and range from simple substances like phenolic acids or phenols, cumarines, flavonoids, and quinines to very complex ones such as lignins and tannins. Phenol and its chemical derivatives are used in the production of detergents, phenoxy herbicides, numerous pharmaceutical drugs, and many industrial synthetic goods. Alkaloids are cyclic bitter organic compounds containing nitrogen in a negative state of oxidation having a marked physiological action on man and other animals. A large variety of organisms produce alkaloids, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Alkaloids like caffeine, ephedrine, codeine, colchicine, nicotine, pilocarpine, opium, quinine, reserpine, cocaine, psilocin morphine, atropine, berberine, vincristine, yohimbine, etc., are some common examples of drugs principles of pharmaceutical importance and often are used as recreational drugs, or in entheogenic rituals. A glycoside is a heteromolecule consisting of a non-sugar (aglycone) and a sugar part (glycone) components. The glycone may be monosaccharide or oligosaccharide, and the aglycone may be an alcohol, anthraquinone derivative, phenol, aldehyde, acid, ester, or another compound. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms, and many such plant glycosides are used as medications, e.g., the active principles of digitalis, strophanthus, cascara, willow, and poplar barks are being among the most valued remedies. The bitter principles are mostly terpenoid, especially the sesquiterpene lactones, monoterpene iridoids, and the secoiridoids. Diterpene bitters are found in columbo root and white horehound, and triterpenoids are the cause of bitterness in Cucurbitaceous plants, which is due to cucurbitacins. Plant lignans are diphenolic compounds (phenylpropanoids dimers) whose structure is the union of two units of phenylpropane. Tannins are non-nitrogenous bitter plant polyphenolic compounds having a molecular weight between 500 and 3000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 (proanthocyanidins). They are non-crystallisable colloidal compounds and may be (i) hydrolyzable tannins, which consist of gallic acid or related polyhydric compounds esterified with glucose, and they are readily hydrolysed to yield the phenolic acids and the sugar; and (ii) non-hydrolyzable or condensed tannins contain only phenolic nuclei and most of such tannins are formed by the condensation of two or more flavanols, such as catechin. Pharmaceutically, tannins have antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, astringent, and antiseptic properties, and may be used in the treatment of hemorrhages (constrict of blood vessels), burns (cicatrizing), diarrhea, and as an antidote for alkaloid poisoning because of their ability to precipitate alkaloids; effective against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicity and also have anti-inflammatory and antiulcer activity. Quinones are cyclic organic compounds (aromatic diketones) and are found in bacteria, in certain fungi, in various higher plant forms, and in a few animals (e.g., sea urchins, aphids, lac insects, and certain scale insects). It is highly active anti-microbacterial, antifungal agent and highly toxic and fatal if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin and widely used in medicine, herbicides, chemical reagents, dyes, and tanning agents. Saponins are amphiphilic glucoside molecules composed of hydrophilic glycoside glycone and lipophilic triterpene or steroid aglycone. Saponins have been used in medicine, foaming agents, in fire extinguishers, and fish poisons. Drugs that influence heart or drugs having an influence on the heart are cardioactive drugs. (i) Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, (ii) calcium channel blocking drugs, and (iii) cardiac glycosides are three major classes of cardioactive drugs. Cardiac glycosides are also important in the pathogenesis and therapy of different human diseases (e.g., stroke, diabetes, neurological diseases, cancer, etc.). Cardioactive steroids are a class of animal and plant-derived compounds with a steroid nucleus and a specific inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effect. Cardioactive steroids (CAS) became the mainstay of treatment for congestive heart failure and to control the ventricular response rate in atrial tachydysrhythmias. Antibiotics are produced by different groups of microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes and in many cases by higher plants. Antibiotics in low concentration are capable of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms through an antimetabolic mechanism. They differ from antiseptics and disinfectants in their mode of action, chemical, and physical properties. The development of resistance among the microorganisms on prolonged contact with the drug is the present-day problems in the field of antibiotics. The microbial and plant sources from the terrestrial and marine environments are now providing natural products with antitumor activity.",,,Progress in Drug Research,Therapeutic Use of Medicinal Plants and their Extracts: Volume 2,Springer Nature,"0071-786X, 2297-4555",,24/06/2018,2018,24/06/2018,2018,74,,165-309,Closed,Chapter,"Alamgir, A.

There have been many developments in the field of alkaloid analysis since the 1950s, not the least of which are the various powerful spectroscopic methods, which dominate this volume. Included also are the various aspects of tobacco alkaloids and analysis in various situations. The complexities of sampling and analysis in tobacco smoke is explained. Analysis of alkaloids produced by tobacco root cell cultures is included, while genetic and chemical analysis is described for Papaver, a plant of considerable medicinal significance.",,,Molecular Methods of Plant Analysis,,Springer Nature,0937-8340,,1994,1994,,1994,15,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028145968,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,Tobacco; Tobacco Smoke and Health,,,Lung Cancer,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being

The use of these drugs remains a continuous threat in health and medical care delivery, and this book will be an essential asset to the physician who may have to face the evaluation of patients whose use of these drugs compromises an effective treatment plan for other health issues. The book has been conceived to fill the void in existing physician reference materials, and provides a comprehensive review of the theoretical knowledge and scope of pharmacotherapy in individuals who are hooked on a psychoactive substance. While detailed scientific information is obtainable in other major articles, the book's straightforward format and style, along with its illustrations, will make for easy reading as emphasis is put on information specifically related to drugs that occur most abused in today’s society. The information provided is based on clinical practice rather than pure experimental data, which will give the physician more effective tools useful in their daily practice. Many mechanisms of action of abuse are described in detail and references are provided to direct the reader to further sources for additional information. As a special feature, the book incorporates uncluttered tables and charts, which result in immediate clarification of the mode of action on the central nervous system and the reason for misuse, thus avoiding usual long and fatiguing text in common reference books. The book aims to give the reader a clear and concise plan on what to do when being faced with an overdose situation. A well-organized Table of Contents rapidly leads the reader from general pharmacological issues to the specific overdose syndrome and its management. Additionally, significant emphasis is placed on the practical do's and don’ts for physicians, with special reference to the predictive signs of aberrant drug-related behavior and the identification of the drug diverter by using urine drug screening.",,,,,Springer Nature,,,2010,2010,,2010,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Freye, Enno","Freye, Enno (Deichstr. 3 a, 41468, Neuss-Uedesheim, Germany)",,"Freye, Enno ()",,,,,,,,,,,41,10,,5.07,4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018921355,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Patient Safety; Substance Misuse,,,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",3 Good Health and Well Being

Examples of drugs within this group include LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. Despite their structural differences, these compounds produce remarkably similar experiences in humans and share a common mechanism of action. Commonalities among the substances in this family are addressed both at the clinical and phenomenological level and at the basic neurobiological mechanism level. To the extent possible, contributions relate the clinical and preclinical findings to one another across species. The volume addresses both the risks associated with the use of these drugs and the potential medical benefits that might be associated with these and related compounds.",,,Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences,,Springer Nature,"1866-3370, 1866-3389",,2018,2018,,2018,36,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,14,,4.27,244,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-3-662-55880-5%2F1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1109509223,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,Neurosciences,,,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",

HPLC has caused a revolution in biological and pharmaceutical chemistry. Approximately two thirds of the publications on HPLC are concerned with problems from this area of life science. Biotechnology, where it is necessary to isolate substances from complicated mixtures, is likely to give further impetus to the dissemination of modern liquid chromatog­ raphy in columns, particularly on the preparative scale. This book presents, by means of examples, the application of HPLC to various fields, as well as fundamental discussions of chromatographic methods. The quality of the analytical result is decisively dependent on the qualities of the equipment employed (by Colin, Guiochon, and Martin). Especially the demands are discussed that are placed on the components of the instrument including those for data acquisition and processing. The section on ""quantitative analy­ sis"" (by ABhauer, Ullner) covers besides the principles also the problems of ensuring the quality of the data in detail. The basic problems arising by enlarging the sample size to preparative di­ mensions and the requirements put on the aparatus are discussed in the section on ""preparative applications"" (by Wehrli).",,,Chemical Laboratory Practice,,Springer Nature,0172-4967,,1986,1986,,1986,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,2,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027108375,34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,,,,,,B12 Engineering,

Although early attempts were made in the 20th century to document various components of the mycota of North America, no extensive list of taxonomic names has ever been compiled for this region. This paper represents the first comprehensive checklist for nonlichenized Fungi from North America, which is defined here as Canada, Mexico, and the United States (and its territories), and is based on the efforts of 75 fungaria that deposited their data online in the Mycology Collections Portal (MyCoPortal). This protochecklist is compiled from nearly 2.2 million records and includes 44 488 fungal names based on the MycoBank taxonomic thesaurus, with differences discussed that reflect discrepancies from the estimate of 46 118 taxa derived from a second list based on the Index Fungorum thesaurus. Approximately 114 000 type specimens (i.e., holo-, iso-, lecto-, syntypes, etc.) representing more than 52 000 typified taxa occur in the MyCoPortal, and of these, ca. 53 000 type specimens representing more than 18 000 typified taxa are described from North America. Several known problems exist with this protochecklist, including orthographical errors, unresolved synonymies, and incomplete taxonomy. The result offers a list of taxonomic names for discussion and provides a foundation for future systematic and taxonomic revisions and the discovery of new records and novel taxa for the region. Furthermore, this protochecklist serves as a baseline for documenting fungal taxa in North America more effectively and comprehensively.","Ben Brandt is thanked for conducting the MySQL queries on the MyCoPortal database, and Phil Anders is thanked for writing the scripts for data analyses. We also thank Brandon Matheny and other anonymous reviewers for providing helpful comments and thorough reviews of the manuscript.",The development and success of the Mycology Collections Portal that has enabled the production of this protochecklist would not have been possible without support from the National Science Foundation Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program through awards to the Macrofungi Collections Consortium (DBI-1206197) and Microfungi Collections Consortium (DBI-1502735) Thematic Collections Networks.,Mycologia,,Taylor & Francis,"0027-5514, 1557-2536",,02/11/2018,2018,28/11/2018,02/11/2018,110,6,1222-1348,All OA; Green,Article,"Bates, Scott T.; Miller, Andrew N.; Consortia, the Macrofungi Collections and Microfungi Collections","Bates, Scott T.

263,pub.1108122422,10.4324/9781315269320,,,9.78132E+12,Psychopharmacology,"With increases in the prevalence of psychiatric and behavioral disorders and rapid advances in the development of new drug therapies, there is an increasing need to present the science behind these developments. Students and educators are often confronted with conflicting and exaggerated claims about the effectiveness of drugs. As recently as ten years ago, the mechanisms of action of many medications prescribed for common psychological disorders were not well understood, even by the scientists developing them. Now, drug treatment has advanced to a stage where drugs are designed for their effects on specific receptors, membrane proteins, or secondary messengers within particular cells in the brain. This text introduces a sufficient background in neuroanatomy and physiology so students can comprehend the necessary details of drug action. Psychopharmacology, Second Edition, presents its subject matter in the context of the behavioral disorders they are designed to treat, rather than by traditional drug classifications. Students are often familiar with the major diagnostic categories, so presenting psychopharmacology as it pertains to these familiar disorders strengthens their understanding of the physiology and neurochemistry underlying them as well as the approaches to their treatment. Each disorder is discussed from a historical context along with diagnostic criteria and descriptions of typical cases. In addition, what we presently know about the underlying pathology of each disorder is carefully described. A critical examination of drug claims is missing from most psychopharmacology texts, but is offered here. Students will read about the most current research available from a critical perspective. When alternatives to traditional drug therapies are supported by research, these studies are presented as well. Throughout, this text discusses how drug effectiveness is measured in both human and animal studies. Psychopharmacology has contributed significantly over the past 75 years to the treatment of severe psychological disorders as well as to our understanding of the brain and human behavior. This symbiotic relationship between psychopharmacology and the neural and behavioral sciences will continue long into the future. This fully updated second edition is ideal for undergraduate and pre-professional students, and includes a robust companion website.",,,,,Taylor & Francis,,,03/02/2017,2017,03/02/2017,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Ettinger, R.

In this book, while covering fundamental concepts, we try to go a little further and address also active workers in the field of forensic chemistry. This is mainly achieved by relatively nu­ merous literature references. We hope that they may assist the forensic chemist in penetrating further into the subjects covered in this volume. At the end of most chapters there are examples of actual cases handled at the Swedish National Laboratory of Forensic Science. Many of these cases could, no doubt, have been investigated in greater detail, but they reflect the compromises often necessary for achieving a reasonable turnover. Some parts of the book are quite strongly colored by the personal opinions of the authors. We felt that these passages will give a little more life to the text than in other treatises of a more objective, but possibly duller character.

Of these macrofungi, many are directly related to people’s daily life and have been utilized by ancient Chinese for at least 6800 years. In this study, we evaluate the current known resource diversity of Chinese macrofungi. A total of 1662 taxa are summarized, and all species names and their authorities have been checked and corrected according to authentic mycological databases. Among the 1662 taxa, 1020, 692, and 480 are considered to be edible, medicinal and poisonous mushrooms, respectively. A few of edible macrofungi in China are commonly used for commercial production. All known medicinal functions are labeled for medicinal species. The most common medicinal functions possessed by Chinese macrofungi are antitumor or anticancer, followed by antioxidant and antimicrobial. A total of 277 Chinese macrofungi are edible simultaneously with certain medicinal functions and without known toxicity. These species could be treated as “Gold Mushrooms”. Contrarily, 193 edible and/or medicinal species are also recognized as poisonous mushrooms. To avoid poisoning caused by these species, ingestion either in a proper way or in small amounts is important. However, the mycotoxins metabolized by these poisonous species could be a huge wealth of natural products yet to be explored. How to utilize these Chinese macrofungal resources is a critical to benefit humans worldwide.","The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos.

The members of the International Association of Forensic Toxicologists provide a valuable service through the association's bulletin. In its pages members hear of new poisons as they are encountered and the analytical techniques used to deal with them. There is a wealth of information in the form of case reports which is used to assist with the interpretation of the results. Each year the members have the opportunity of meeting in Europe. In 1979 the chosen venue was the University of Glasgow and the meeting was hosted by the Department of Forensic Medicine and Science. The department was established by Royal Charter in 1839 within a few years of the beginning of the modern approach to toxicology. In those early years the function of the department was to teach forensic medicine and toxicology. Today the department has become a recognised centre for the teaching of forensic medicine. The toxicology section has expanded greatly to provide the best forensic and environmental toxicology in Scotland. Inorganic analytical facilities are available for the investigation of metallic poisons by atomic absorption spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, X-ray fluorescence and anodic stripping voltametry. Organic analytical toxicology is pursued using gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, immunoassays, and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Apart from the normal research and routine investigations of a toxicological laboratory the department specialises in the investigation of fire related deaths, solvent abuse (glue sniffing) and trace element studies in human subjects.",,,,,Springer Nature,,,1980,1980,,1980,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037037829,34 Chemical Sciences; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context,,,,,,D28 History,3 Good Health and Well Being

The term ‘drug misuse’ covers a wide range of drug using activity, such as ‘experimentation’, weekend ‘rave’ drug use and heroin dependence. Professionals, drug misusers and the public may all have different perceptions of what constitutes ‘problem drug use’. Throughout this century, drug misuse has concerned politicians, doctors and the public to varying degrees at any given time - but concern at today's illicit drug use coincides with a real increase in overall levels of drug taking, particularly amongst young people. There are serious risks for the individual using drugs which may result from the direct action of the drug itself on the body, the route of administration, such as injecting, or by indirect effects such as accidents or the chaotic lifestyle which may result from severe dependence. Injecting drug users are at considerable risk from infection by HIV and hepatitis viruses and from other infections and diseases of the circulatory system. All professionals whose work involves helping those who use illicit drugs will find this book invaluable, especially GPs. other doctors and their health care colleagues who have responsibility to provide medical services for their patients.

Because of the devastating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, caused by the human immunodeficiency retrovirus, it is now accepted that suppressed immune responses, especially cellular immu­ nity, are important contributors to increased individual susceptibility to opportunistic infections-including infections caused by fungi which were at one time thought to be very lowly or nonpathogenic. Within the last few years, there has been an almost explosive increase in interest and studies concerning the nature and mechanisms of the immune response to fungal infections. Many immunologists who are not well versed in mycology have begun to study the nature and mechanisms of antifungal immunity using a wide variety of newer as well as more conventional immunologic technologies, both in vivo and in vitro. Up to the 1980s, however, there was little interest among basic immunologists concerning fungal immunity.

Not only are narratives of re-enchantment appearing in popular culture at the personal and spiritual level, but also they are often accompanied by a pragmatic approach that calls for political activism and the desire to change the world to incorporate these new ideas. Drawing on case studies of particular groups, including pagans, witches, radical faeries, post-modern tourists, and queer and goddess groups, contributors from Australia, the UK and North America discuss various forms of spirituality and how they contribute to self-knowledge, identity, and community life.

They affect the well-being of each community and nation as a whole. It is, therefore, necessary to identify, educate, and treat individuals who are addicted to substances. Policies and procedures go hand-in-hand with public health education and safety. The science behind the public health issues of one drug may be applicable to other drugs as well. However, marshalling all of the aforementioned information into a single source is somewhat difficult due to the wide array of material. The Editors address this by compiling the research in this single reference work that serves as a ""one-stop-shopping"" approach to everything readers need to know about the scientific basis of public health and addictions and agents of misuse. Apart from active agents that have a plant or chemical basis, there is a need to consider that there are other forms of addiction which may have common modes of causality or prevention. These include food addiction, gaming, gambling, and other non-drug addictions. These types of addiction may be related to the addiction of drugs. The Handbook of Substance Misuse and Addictions: From Biology to Public Health offers a holistic understanding of the relationship between public health and substance misuse. The text provides a common platform upon which other forms of addiction or substance misuse can be understood and treated. Addiction processes involve understanding the biological processes as well as behavior, psychology, sociology, and public health, all of which are interlinked. This Handbook is a useful reference for lecturers, students, researchers, practitioners, and other professionals in public health, addiction science, epidemiology, health education, health promotion, and health sciences.",,,,,Springer Nature,,,2022,2022,,2022,,,,All OA; Bronze,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,7,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-3-030-92392-1%2F1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151952465,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Prescription Drug Abuse; Substance Misuse,Mental health,,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",3 Good Health and Well Being; 4 Quality Education

The participatory management of headwater catchments in Europe, Africa, America and Asia was the central theme of the articles, which were divided into four sessions: (1) Headwater Environment and Natural Resources, (2) Enhancing Environmental Services in Headwaters, (3) Environmental Services in the Changing World, and (4) New Challenges for Environmental Education and Active Citizenship.

Frühere Versuche, die psychische Symptomatik von Kindern und Jugendlichen retrograd aus Krankheitsbildern Erwachsener abzuleiten, stehen im Gegensatz zu ihrer Entelechie. Aber auch eine Psychopathologie, die für alle Entwicklungs- und Altersstufen gültig wäre, ist eine Fiktion. Schon das Neugeborene und der Säugling sind sehr kompetente Wesen, und das Klein- und Schulkind und der Jugendliche sowie junge Erwachsene machen mit einem manchmal fast überfallartig einsetzenden Zeitraffertempo so stürmische Entwicklungsfortschritte, daß auch mit subtilen Untersuchungstechniken nicht immer eine zuverlässige Nosographie psychischer Erkrankungen möglich ist.

Addiction Medicine addresses this disconnect, clearly explaining the role of brain function in drug taking and other habit-forming behaviors, and applying this biobehavioral framework to the delivery of evidence-based treatment. Its state-of-the-art coverage provides clinically relevant details on not only traditional sources of addiction such as cocaine, opiates, and alcohol, but also more recently recognized substances of abuse (e.g., steroids, inhalants) as well as behavioral addictions (e.g., binge eating, compulsive gambling, hoarding). Current behavioral and medical therapies are discussed in depth, and the book’s close attention to social context gives readers an added lens for personalizing treatment.   An international panel of expert contributors offers the most up-to-date information on:   Diagnosis and classification. Neurobiological and molecular theories of addiction Behavioral concepts of addiction Clinical aspects of addiction to a wide range of substances, including opiates, stimulants, sedatives, hallucinogens, alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine Science-based treatment options: pharmacotherapy, pharmacogenetics, potential vaccines, brief and compliance-enhancing interventions, cognitive behavioral treatment, behavioral management, and other psychosocial interventions Behavioral addictions—including compulsive eating, Internet messaging, and hypersexuality—and their treatment Addiction in specific populations, including adolescents, the elderly, pregnant women, and health care professionals Legal, disability, and rehabilitation issues   At once comprehensive and integrative, Addiction Medicine is an essential text and a practice-expanding tool for psychiatrists, health psychologists, pharmacologists, social workers, drug counselors, trainees, and general physicians/family practitioners.",,,,,Springer Nature,,,2011,2011,,2011,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31,8,,3.96,28,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-1-4419-0338-9%2F1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005871667,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Mental Health; Neurosciences; Substance Misuse,Mental health,,,,"A04 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience",3 Good Health and Well Being

While many technical STM works explore the chemistry and biology of pharmacology and an equally large number of clinically oriented works focus on use of illegal drugs, substance abuse, and treatment, there is virtually nothing on the immensely huge business (“Big Pharma”) of creating, selling, consuming, and regulating legal drugs. With this new Encyclopedia, the topic of socioeconomic, business and consumer, and legal and ethical issues of the pharmaceutical industry in contemporary society around the world are addressed. Key Features: • 800 signed articles, authored by prominent scholars, are arranged A-to-Z and published in a choice of electronic or print formats • Although arranged A-to-Z, a Reader's Guide in the front matter groups articles by thematic areas • Front matter also includes a Chronology highlighting significant developments in this field • All articles conclude with Further Readings and Cross References to related articles • Back matter includes an annotated Resource Guide to further research, a Glossary, Appendices (e.g., statistics on the amount and types of drugs prescribed, etc.), and a detailed Index • The Index, Reader’s Guide, and Cross References combine for search-and-browse capabilities in the electronic edition.

The main application of white biotechnology is commercial production of various useful organic substances, such as acetic acid, citric acid, acetone, glycerine, etc., and antibiotics like penicillin, streptomycin, mitomycin, etc., and value added product through the use of microorganisms especially fungi and bacteria. The value-added products included bioactive compounds, secondary metabolites, pigments and industrially important enzymes for potential applications in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, medicine and allied sectors for human welfare. In the 21st century, techniques were developed to harness fungi to protect human health (through antibiotics, antimicrobial, immunosuppressive agents, value-added products etc.), which led to industrial scale production of enzymes, alkaloids, detergents, acids, biosurfactants. The first large-scale industrial applications of modern biotechnology have been made in the areas of food and animal feed production (agricultural/green biotechnology) and pharmaceuticals (medical/red biotechnology). In contrast, the production of bio-active compounds through fermentation or enzymatic conversion is known industrial or white biotechnology. The beneficial fungal strains may play important role in agriculture, industry and the medical sectors. The beneficial fungi play a significance role in plant growth promotion, and soil fertility using both, direct (solubilization of phosphorus, potassium and zinc; production of indole acetic acid, gibberellic acid, cytokinin and siderophores) and indirect (production of hydrolytic enzymes, siderophores, ammonia, hydrogen cyanides and antibiotics) mechanisms of plant growth promotion for sustainable agriculture. The fungal strains and their products (enzymes, bio-active compounds and secondary metabolites) are very useful for industry. The discovery of antibiotics is a milestone in the development of white biotechnology. Since then, white biotechnology has steadily developed and now plays a key role in several industrial sectors, providing both high valued nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical products. The fungal strains and bio-active compounds also play important role in the environmental cleaning. This volume covers the latest research developments related to value-added products in white biotechnology through fungi.",,,Fungal Biology,,Springer Nature,"2198-7777, 2198-7785",,2019,2019,,2019,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,53,10,,8.09,1,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-3-030-14846-1%2F1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113955998,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",2 Zero Hunger

Auflage dieses Lehrbuches. Gründe für eine Neubearbeitung nach nur vier Jahren gab es genug: Infektionen beschäftigen mittlerweile selbst höchste politische Gremien, wie die jährlichen G8-Konferenzen zeigen. Globalisierungsfolgen, z.B. Migration, Kriege und ein Dasein in Flüchtlingslagern sowie die Verelendung ganzer Landstriche, leisten der Verbreitung von Krankheitserregern Vorschub, und die nächste Seuche kommt bestimmt. Die enorme Wichtigkeit der Identifizierung neuer Krankheitserreger wurde vom Nobelkomitee im Jahr 2005 – genau 100 Jahre nach der Ehrung Robert Kochs für die Entdeckung des Tuberkulose-Erregers – durch die Verleihung des Nobelpreises an die Entdecker des »Magenbakteriums« Helicobacter pylori anerkannt. Grundkenntnisse in Mikrobiologie, Immunologie und Infektionslehre sind daher für Ärztinnen und Ärzte unabdingbar. Die Reaktionen der Leserschaft haben gezeigt, dass der Grundgedanke des Lehrbuches, in erster Linie ein Verständnis pathophysiologischer Zusammenhänge zu vermitteln, unverändert richtig ist. Infektionsbiologische Forschung hat sich nun auch in Deutschland an den naturwissenschaftlichen - kultäten als wichtige Forschungsrichtung durchgesetzt. Deshalb ist dieses Buch nicht nur für Mediziner, sondern auch für forschende Infektionsbiologen gedacht, die sich über die medizinischen Hintergründe und die klinische Relevanz ihrer Arbeiten informieren möchten. Die Herausgeber hoffen, dass das Lehrbuch auch bei diesen Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern auf gute Resonanz stoßen wird.",,,Springer-Lehrbuch,,Springer Nature,"0937-7433, 2512-5214",,2009,2009,,2009,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,0,,,4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-3-540-46362-7/1?pdf=chapter%20toc,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045214411,,,,,,,,

The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, on the other hand, is the wee babes. Ian Sansom, The Guardian The Concise New Partridge presents, for the first time, all the slang terms from the New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English in a single volume. With over 60,000 entries from around the English-speaking world, the Concise gives you the language of beats, hipsters, Teddy Boys, mods and rockers, hippies, pimps, druggies, whores, punks, skinheads, ravers, surfers, Valley girls, dudes, pill-popping truck drivers, hackers, rappers and more.

The second part includes the specific drugs; the third part gives the description of environmental and occupational nephrotoxins. The last part deals with the patient with some degree of renal failure, exposed to drugs and chemicals, the progression of renal disease, and how to adapt drug dosage. In this third and completely revised edition, nine new chapters were added, from proton pump inhibitors to bisphosphonates, phosphate containing laxatives, oxalate, star fruit and smoking. All chapters were extended with up-to-date references.
